Dogs have a hearing range of up to 45 khz, humans can only go up to 20 khz, but cats can go up to as much as 79 khz. I have two cats that normally get on, but with both my pregnancies they constantly used to fight each other for my attention!</p>

<p>Of course they�re not people (technically), but your feline or canine companions are especially equipped to sense things like this. Cats have almost as good a sense of smell as dogs do. They can sense changes in the weather, earthquakes, and volcano eruptions. Can cats sense pregnancy in their owners ; Reddit’s baby bumps community is full of stories of cats engaging in extra clingy behavior around expectant mothers.it’s a topic that has come up again and again.</p>

<p>Cats have 20 square centimetres of scent surface (the respiratory epithelium) in their noses, compared with our two to four square centimetres. They can detect vapors and smells that people are not even aware of. Ultrasound can also detect pregnancy in a cat. We have heard stories of animals sensing an earthquake, eruption from a volcano or any changes in weather before humans can, which astonishes everyone. Sometimes when cats sense pregnancy, they may even act more protective toward you.</p>
