Bones should be raw, as they do not splinter as often as cooked ones do. The bones of the turkey are easily broken into smaller fragments that can puncture the dog�s mouth, stomach, and intestines and lead to infection.</p>

<p>Can dogs and cats be allergic to turkey? Cats and turkey bones aren’t an honest combination. Like with dogs, cats can eat the raw, meaty bones of animals including turkey. Is it safe for adult dogs or not? Cooked bones in general become more brittle and they splinter more easily.</p>

<p>Bones also have sharp edges that can block or pierce a cat’s intestines during digestion. Cooked bones may be even more harmful than raw bones, because they’re brittle and may splinter, causing injuries in your cat’s mouth, throat, stomach, or intestines. Dont give them foods that are very salty or spicy as this can be bad for them. Adult cats are fine to have turkey as a. The bones of turkeys are not safe for dogs to eat.</p>
