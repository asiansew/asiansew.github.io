<p>The names, characters, places, and incidents are products of the writer’s imagination or have been used fictitiously and are not to be construed as real. Cat’s cradle (1963) is vonnegut�s most ambitious novel, which put into the language terms like wampeter, kerass and granfalloon as well as a structured religion, boskonism and was submitted in partial fulfillment of requirements for a master�s degree in anthropology, and in its sprawling compass and almost uncontrolled (and uncontrollable) invention, may be vonnegut�s best novel. The book is in simple english language so its easier for the readers to understand it. Whatever it is, the members of its karass revolve about it in the majestic chaos of a spiral nebula. The book was published in multiple languages including english, consists of 306 pages and is available in paperback format.</p>
