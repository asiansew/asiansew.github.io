Bananas do contain some of the vitamins and minerals that cats need for good health, but they can get these through the carnivorous diet that they should be eating. According to the aspca, bananas are not toxic to cats. Cats can eat bananas, however, there are better things to feed your cat.</p>

<p>However, some people argue that it is safe for cats to eat bananas, and the bananas might not be toxic to them after all, which makes it a little confusing. Gates, who began the foundation as a way to educate people about cat food, says, “cats have no requirement for carbohydrates in their diet and feeding carbs to cats can lead to many problems.” [1] bananas are rich in vitamin b6, manganese, vitamin c, potassium and dietary fibre. Most experts agree that there should be no problem for a cat to eat bananas, as long as it is done in moderation. Since bananas are safe for cats, they can be given as healthy snacks.</p>

<p>Yet, a cat can’t taste sweetness resulting from a lack of a genetic need to develop that. Thus, cats don’t need a treat likes bananas, chocolate, candy, and other types of sweet treats. Nutrients in a banana • carbohydrates, fiber • potassium • sodium • proteins: These are a good source of vitamins b6 and c, potassium, and carbohydrates. Cats do not have enzymes that can digest sugars or carbohydrates.</p>
