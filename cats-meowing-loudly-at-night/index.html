<p>Caterwauling takes place at night as the streets are largely quiet and empty then. Caterwauling takes place at night as the streets are largely quiet and empty then. This could be due to changes in their environment, or perhaps if they�ve moved house. A senior cat making noise at night invariably has an explanation. Living outdoors also leads to many dangerous and unpredictable situations for stray cats, from being run over by rapidly speeding cars to nonstop violent altercations with other animals (especially when it comes to tomcats).</p>

<p>When my cats yowl at night, and only two of them do it, they get two a warnings. Most older cats want the opportunity for undisturbed sleep. Well… until they start doing things which can really frustrate us. Cats are naturally more active at night. They become family right away.</p>

<p>This common feline behaviour can occur because of a cat’s natural instincts, because of other factors at play, or both. When does meowing become excessive? So if this is a new behaviour for your cat, or the cat is elderly, your vet can take a blood sample to test for any underlying conditions. Ignore the meowing unless the tone, frequency or quality of the vocalization suggests an emergency. No, this article is about geriatric cats yowling or screaming — these cats sound genuinely distressed.they may walk aimlessly, not trying to communicate with you — just vocalizing.</p>
