<p>This system controls parts of the body not consciously operated such as heartbeat, digestive system, and pupillary response. Thankfully, such toxicity is rare in felines. The most serious of these are feline leukemia, toxicity, dysautonomia or tumors. I took a flashlight and checked both her eyes they both react to light properly just one is always dilated more then the other. She sees fine i feel like.</p>

<p>Each eye is a different color. This condition means only one pupil is dilated. The iris is the colored part of the eye. Also, her eyes seem to reflect different colors. My cat�s eyes are very dilated.</p>
