All the different kinds of berries that are safe for humans to eat are also safe for cockatiels, such as raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, cranberries, etc. They can be tempted to eat by slightly warming their food, offering foods that are tasty (due to high levels of protein or fat) or have a strong odour, and by offering variety, including new and different foods. They should be cut into small pieces to avoid choking, and can be mashed or pureed for smaller dogs. So make sure to wash the fruits thoroughly before giving them to your pup.</p>

<p>Dog bodies are different than ours, meaning they can eat some of the same foods we can, but need to stay.

<p>Even in the wild, dogs can and do eat fruit and veg as part of their diets, which can provide a wide range of health benefits and ensure that all of their nutritional needs are met.
