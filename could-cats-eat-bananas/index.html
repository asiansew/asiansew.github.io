<p>But it is better to say that you should not feed a banana to cats. Namely, just because your cat can eat a banana, might not mean that he should. Lisa selvaggio she is certified in clinical pet nutrition, and enjoys helping pet parents give their fur babies the best care possible. In the latter case, however, the owner should make very certain that the burger doesn’t contain garlic or onions, for both are dangerously toxic to cats. Bananas are not on the list of toxic foods for cats.</p>

<p>But before you let your cat go bananas on a banana (ha!), it’s important to consider the pros and cons. They are safe to feed to your feline friend, and it turns out that many cats actually enjoy them. Just because bananas are not outright harmful to felines, they should not make up the core of a cat’s diet. Perhaps you’ve heard that fruit can be. The short answer is yes—bananas are generally considered to be safe for cats.</p>
