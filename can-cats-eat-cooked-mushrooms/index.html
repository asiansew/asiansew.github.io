<p>This means you could potentially share your favorite cooked mushrooms with your cat, but try to refrain. Onions, garlic, shallots, and scallions can cause damage to your cat. Mushrooms are rarely cooked without any kind of season or extra flavors, and some of the extras we use in our food prep can be very harmful for our dog. Some cats love the smell of mushrooms and would eat them, if they could get their paws on some. You can use it as a treat sometimes at the max.</p>

<p>The safest ones that you can share with your pet are those sold at grocery stores and markets. One fact is that cats are really attracted by the taste and texture of mushrooms, finding them really savory which doesn’t necessarily mean that they are also healthy for them. In general, mushrooms that are safe for people are not toxic to cats or other pets. Cats need protein, but they should get it strictly from animal meat. A small amount of cooked mushrooms won’t do any harm to your rat and it could be a delicious healthy snack.</p>
