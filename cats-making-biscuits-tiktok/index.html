<p>Studies reveal owners can catch the deadly bug, even if their pets don�t show any symptoms. Typically called “kneading,” you might have other names for this adorable (and slightly painful) practice — like “making biscuits,” “making bread” or “making muffins” — basically making any sort of delicious and carby treat. Making these homemade dog treats is very similar to making sugar cookies. I don’t think moira ever stops making biscuits. This has prompted scientists who led the study to call for more research into whether cats can catch coronavirus from people, and infect people with it. Once cats are mature enough to go without their mum’s milk, they may continue kneading when they feel at ease, as an instinctual reminder of those cozy days of youthful teat sucking.</p>
