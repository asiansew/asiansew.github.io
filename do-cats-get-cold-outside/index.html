<p>Similarly to humans, some cats may feel the cold more than others. The fact is that the cold virus that humans get is not susceptible to the common felines that gift us with their presence in our lives. The answers are yes and yes. As the air gets colder and the holidays get closer, we wanted to take some time and talk about holiday hazards that could potentially be dangerous to your pet. If you have an indoor cat, then you do not have to worry too much about trying to keep your cat warm.</p>

<p>It’s easy to do with the right items. Take a look at our top tips. Since cats have to walk &amp; get up on them (where ever they are placed) and it rains &amp; snows in the winter, then the cats get wet. During periods of cold weather, cats will go looking for a warm place to hunker down. Pets or owned roaming cats are generally socialized and have had contact with people, while feral cats live solo or in colonies and are bonded to the other cats who live in their colony.</p>

<p>When the thermometer dips below freezing, it is important to protect your cats from the cold spell. So what should you do when you see a cat outside during the winter? The fact is that the cold virus that humans get is not susceptible to the common felines that gift us with their presence in our lives. Yes, your cat can indeed catch a cold, but not the kind that you or i might catch, although it may look like the same thing. Do you take care of feral cats (unsocialized to people) that roam outside and do you provide them a soft place to sleep as well as provide them with fresh water and food to eat?</p>

<p>Cat colds typically last from one to four weeks depending on how quickly they’re diagnosed and treated. This means the blankets get wet. During periods of cold weather, cats will go looking for a warm place to hunker down. Cats that are outdoors may crawl into a warm car engine to get warm. Cold weather can be hard on cats, just like it can be hard on people.</p>
