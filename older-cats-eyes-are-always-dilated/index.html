<p>Sleepy relaxed cats have slit pupils. Are your cats eyes always dilated?. Withdrawal from these drugs can also make the pupils stay open. She has always had very striking big eyes. My cat�s eyes appear to have become more dilated slowly over the last 6 months.</p>

<p>Multiple health concerns are connected to dilated pupils. She has always had very striking big eyes. Are your cat�s eyes dilated all the time? Anyway i figured she belonged to someone because she was very fat or she was pregnant so i asked. Watery eyes, just like in humans, can mean that the eye is dry, which is easily resolved with eye drops.</p>

<p>Cats have evolved to hide signs of illness and pain. This is a response to her increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure. What i mean by that is they get moon eyes when they get excited. One of the things you may notice as your cat ages is that his brilliant eyes become cloudy or hazy. My cat�s eyes appear to have become more dilated slowly over the last 6 months.</p>
