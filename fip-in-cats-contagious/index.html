<p>So, even though a number of cats can be exposed, it�s hard to know w. Al legendre, who described survival over 1 year in three cats diagnosed with fip and treated with the medicine. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a complex, serious, and ultimately fatal disease of cats, caused by a biotype of feline coronavirus (fcov), called feline infectious peritonitis virus or fip virus (fipv). It is caused by a type of virus called a coronavirus,. It is a contagious virus, with the majority of its cases observed in multifeline households, catteries, and shelters.</p>

<p>While fip is not contagious there does seem to be a genetic component to which cats are more prone to the mutation which is why we sometimes see it in cats related to each other. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the abdominal cavity, is only one feature of this systemic disease, which can cause ocular inflammation. Cats with fip do not appear to be very contagious to cats that they come in contact with. Cats are showing clinical signs compatible with fip; It is related to hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) and occurs in about two and half percent of all cats in the united states.</p>

<p>Fip may be considered more likely when: A contagious disease is spread from animal to animal or person to person. Cats become infected after they ingest the virus when they groom or eat. Fip is caused by the mutation of the corona virus, which is highly contagious, as in passed through the litter box, food/water bowls, etc etc. Although fip is not a particularly common disease, it is important because once a cat develops the disease, the outcome is almost invariably fatal.</p>
