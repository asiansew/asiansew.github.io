<p>Kidney failure and diet in cats. First of all, there is no scientific evidence to support that the protein causes further development of the disease. The ideal diet for a cat with ckd contains less than 0.5% phosphorus on a dry matter basis. Additionally, you should consider commercial cat foods for kidney disease and phosphate binders. Whether or not you decide to euthanize your cat is always a personal decision.</p>

If you’re looking for a prescription diet for kidney health, this hill’s prescription diet k/d kidney care canned cat food is a decent option. And from my experience cats with renal disease should not be on k/d or other low protein kidney diets to began with.</p>
