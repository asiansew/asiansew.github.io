Trichinosis is a parasitic roundworm which infects cats when they eat meat infected with cysts containing the larvae of the parasite. Your cat can actually benefit greatly from turkey meat consumption, it contains many of the nutrients felines need in order to have a healthy development.</p>

<p>While cats can eat raw meat and there’s a general trend toward adding more raw meat to their diet, you run the risk of feeding your pet spoiled meat or food contaminated with salmonella or other bacteria. Be careful about bones, and consult your veterinarian about the amount of turkey that is right for your pet. Dogs can eat turkey, but this comes with a few caveats. Cats eat a lot of chicken and they also like turkey so if you give some to your cat they will certainly love it. Turkey breast, wings and legs, cut into chunks.</p>

<p>Yes, your cat can absolutely share your turkey dinner — but with a few stipulations. Turkey can be sold whole, in parts (like legs or breasts), as cold cuts, or as ground meat. Ground beef must be cooked to 165 f. This includes both cooked turkey breast or sliced deli meat. Dear einstein, oooooh, i’m so excited.</p>
