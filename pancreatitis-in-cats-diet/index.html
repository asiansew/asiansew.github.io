The pancreatitis is different than the ibd but in cats they are often all tied together with the triaditis, as your vet suspects. When dogs develop pancreatitis, it is standard protocol to hold them off food until their vomiting subsides and then to begin refeeding with a low fat diet. Surprisingly, very little is known about pancreatitis in cats. Chronic pancreatitis is a recurring condition that requires ongoing care.</p>

<p>It is true that cats that have a lot more fat than normal in their diet are more exposed to developing pancreatitis at one point, and so are those that were poisoned. Pancreatitis occurs when the pancreas becomes inflamed and leaks digestive enzymes into pancreatic tissue. In the cat, inflammation of the pancreas is often part of a larger inflammatory condition that typically involves the liver and intestine, as well as the pancreas. The recommended diet for cats with pancreatitis varies between individuals, particularly if your cat is diagnosed with other health problems. It may seem that only prescription diets can fit all of the above.</p>

The key with cat food is easy digestion. The pancreatitis is different than the ibd but in cats they are often all tied together with the triaditis, as your vet suspects. While there isn’t a universal answer as to why cats get pancreatitis, there’s plenty of evidence pointing to processed foods. Liquid diets are required for use</p>
