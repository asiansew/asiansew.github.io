<p>There are many different strains of feline coronavirus, which differ in their ability to cause disease. Many of the clinical signs of fip are vague and occur with other diseases found in cats. Caring for a cat with fiv is much the same as caring for any other cat; If you have your other cats antibody tested, you may find that they have higher antibody titres than the one which developed fip, but that does not mean that they will develop fip. The mutated virus is not shed by the cat, so while fip is not actually contagious, the more benign feline coronavirus is contagious to other felines.</p>

<p>Feline infectious peritonitis is a very special reaction to infection with the feline enteric coronavirus. It usually occurs in cats at ages of six weeks to two years old. It is also more common in cats from catteries and shelter where there is a large number of cats potentially shedding coronavirus (which is necessary because it is what mutates). Before understanding fip in cats you need to know about feline corona virus (fecv) which gives rise virus of feline infectious peritonitis (fip). All cats should be tested for fiv, and retested any time they’re sick with infection, adopted into a new home, or exposed to other infected cats.</p>

<p>Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) in cats is a viral disease and often proved to be fatal in households and wild cats. Rather, fip develops in individual cats after they are infected with fecv and the virus undergoes mutations to become fipv (fipv itself is not passed in the feces). And may explain the uncommon epizootics of fip where a number of cats in the same environment develop fip within a days or weeks of each other. A contagious disease is spread from animal to animal or person to person. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip), which is caused by a contagious virus, can cause significant illness and death in cats.</p>
