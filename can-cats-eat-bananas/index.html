<p>There is no general consensus as to whether or not bananas are a healthy treat for cats, but unequivocally, yes, cats can eat bananas. It comes down to your priorities as the cat owner watching out for your cat’s diet. They contain proteins, fibers, and vitamins. Do not give your cat the rind or seeds. After all, cats aren’t used to eating so much fiber!</p>
