<p>Most cats love tinned fish, and it is an excellent way to encourage a cat who has lost his or her appetite to eat. But, like raw chicken, bacteria like salmonella or listeria are a concern with raw eggs. Can cats eat raw eggs? Yes, cats can eat eggs. Let’s point out that the big advantage that chicken and rice has is that it’s bland, yet still contains sufficient nutrients and calories to ease your feline friend back to strength.</p>

<p>So can cats eat eggs? Cats can absolutely eat eggs that are hard boiled. Both plain brown rice and plain white rice can be good for cats with an upset stomach, so long as it’s fully cooked. But can dogs eat rice? Cats need protein in their diet, and if you’re tired of feeding her commercial cat food, or if you just want to give her a special treat occasionally, then eggs are a great option.</p>
