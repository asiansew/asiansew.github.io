The pupil constricts or dilates (enlarges) according to the amount of light that enters the eyes, with both pupils normally dilating in dim light and constricting in bright light. Hypertension, commonly referred to as high blood pressure, is a very common physiological culprit of dilated pupils. Unequal pupils, or anisocoria, occurs when one of a cat’s pupils is either too far open or too far closed in relation to the other pupil.

Dilated pupils can signify serious infection, head or brain trauma or tumor, poisoning, or disease and will need diagnostic tests to determine the cause.</p>
