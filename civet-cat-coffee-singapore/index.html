<p>In singapore, the common palm civet is one of the species of civet that can be seen. Kopi luwak is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which were eaten and defecated by the asian palm civet (paradoxurus hermaphroditus).it is therefore also called civet coffee.the cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet�s intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected. Unfortunately, most producers of this type of coffee keep the small animals, which we affectingly know as toddy cats, locked up in cages. Used to produce the exotic expensive luwak coffee in bali, indonesia. The word “kopi” means “coffee” in balinese, while “luwak” is the local name for the palm civet.</p>

<p>Due to such exclusivity, a pound of it costs between us$100 and us$600, easily making it the most expensive coffee in the world! Having tried the civet cat coffee, i will try to describe the experience, which is a challenge. Bearing the face of a raccoon, the ears of a cat and the tail of a monkey, this species is also called the toddy cat for its apparent fondness for fermented palm fruit, which is used to make palm wine or toddy. It may feed on beans from the arabica coffee plant, the robusta, or any other coffee plant available to it. The brewed coffee has a very dark shade of brown with some red undertones.</p>
