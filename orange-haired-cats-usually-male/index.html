These males are almost always sterile and are found to carry an extra x chromosome. Females that carry the orange gene on only one x chromosome are tortoiseshell in color.</p>

<p>Instead, they come in ticked, mackerel, classic, and spotted patterns. Just like humans, there are different shades of ginger between cats. This is because when cats of a certain color get together, the females will often present with tortishell markings. The other two are mostly orange with small, barely perceptible white patches. Or mostly orange with the stray, very small white patch?</p>

<p>For reasons that are not fully understood, about 80% of orange tabby cats are male. Tortoiseshell cats with the tabby pattern as one of their colors are sometimes referred to. “as the frequency of the orange gene is much less than the frequency of the black gene in the general cat population, the chance of having two orange genes is much. All red cats are tabby cats. So, apparently tortoiseshell cats (which can have orange and black and tabby markings) are usually female and ginger, or marmalade cats are usually male.</p>

<p>For reasons that are not fully understood, about 80% of orange tabby cats are male. They hardly come in solid orange. This certainly seems to point to some genetic link between sex and coat markings, although veterinarians and researchers still haven’t seemed to pinpoint the exact factors. Male orange tabby cats outnumber females approximately 4 to 1. Also called torties for short, tortoiseshell cats combine two colors other than white, either closely mixed or in larger patches.</p>

<p>These tonal kitties would be well fitted with a name inspired by their coats. As with humans, female cats have paired sex chromosomes, xx, and male cats have xy sex chromosomes. Tortoiseshell cats with the tabby pattern as one of their colors are sometimes referred to. Tortishell is a recessive gene on the x chromosome, so only females are torti and the males usually present as orange tabby. Thus, both the mother and father cat must pass on the genes to the female, but males only need the trait from their mothers.</p>

Ginger genes work differently in cats compared to people, which makes female ginger cats a little harder to come by. The amount of this pigment reflects how intense the ginger color of the cat is.</p>

<p>Now you know why the orange tabby is so special. About 20% of orange tabbies are estimated to be female. The ‘ginger gene’ which produces the orange colour is on the x chromosome. As with humans, female cats have paired sex chromosomes, xx, and male cats have xy sex chromosomes. Also called torties for short, tortoiseshell cats combine two colors other than white, either closely mixed or in larger patches.</p>

<p>For reasons that are not fully understood, about 80% of orange tabby cats are male. Or mostly orange with the stray, very small white patch? All red cats are tabby cats. The orange tabby color is commonly found in persian, munchkin, american bobtail, and british shorthair, bengal, maine coon, abyssinian, and egyptian mau cats. The majority of orange tabby cats are male.</p>
