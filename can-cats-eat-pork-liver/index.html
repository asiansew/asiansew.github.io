<p>Treatment for a low iron count or anemia is necessary to get your cat�s health back on track. So the answer is that yes, cats can eat pork. You’re not in the wrong here. Because this kind of bologna contains healthy organ meat and is a very good source of vitamin a, it is one of the best foods for cats to eat. As a cat ages, its body needs less protein.</p>

<p>There are different things that cats can not eat other than pork, and you should never give these to your cat. The other problem with pork is its high sodium content. Fluid therapy is often needed to correct the imbalance caused by excessive sodium intake. Because this kind of bologna contains healthy organ meat and is a very good source of vitamin a, it is one of the best foods for cats to eat.

<p>When you think about it, organ meats, including the kidneys, liver, heart, etc., are a normal part of the feline diet. Another justification as to why cats shouldn’t be eating pork is the high risk of contracting unwanted parasites. Beef or lamb liver can be fed to cats but only in small quantities. Onions are the worse of the two, but both should be avoided. Table scraps can contain fat and meat that has been trimmed off the bones, both of which are dangerous for cats to eat.</p>
