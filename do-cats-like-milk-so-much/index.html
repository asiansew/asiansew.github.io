<p>A very tiny bit (like a spoonful) once in a while should not harm your cat in the long run (though it’s always best to check with your veterinarian). Just be careful, because both options are high in fat, and you don�t want to feed your kitty too much of that. Cats are very fond of cream, which they value for its high fat content, and so they are especially attracted to milk that has come straight from the cow, especially after the cream has been allowed to rise to the top. Today’s topic is, why do cats like milk so much. In the wild it�s a rare resource. Because cats are such smart, sentient creatures, they can have a long list of likes (and, perhaps, an equally long list of dislikes!)!) in most cases, the things your cat loves are the very same things you love—like fresh, tasty food, long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun activities, to name a few.</p>

<p>Why do adult cats crave milk? The milk we now buy in supermarkets contains little fat, and while some cats may like it for its taste, many do not find it easy to digest, dr. A small amount can be used as a treat, something to give your cat as a reward or as part of holiday cheer. So, it is best to steer clear of cow’s milk and give them water to drink instead.

Like all mammals, kittens rely on their mothers’ milk as their sole source of nutrition. They don�t do anything half as neat as moving plastic rings. If your cat is fed a high quality, balanced diet they do not need the extra fat from drinking milk, no matter how much they like it.</p>

John bradshaw notes in science focus. Any dairy will make them sick. While some cats can develop lactose intolerance, so be careful, most cats enjoy dairy and cheese is a great source of fat and protein.</p>

<p>Because cats are such smart, sentient creatures, they can have a long list of likes (and, perhaps, an equally long list of dislikes!)!) in most cases, the things your cat loves are the very same things you love—like fresh, tasty food, long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun activities, to name a few. But how a cat shows their love and gives affection is very different from how humans display love. A small amount can be used as a treat, something to give your cat as a reward or as part of holiday cheer. Learn if it�s normal for cats to always drink fresh milk. Also, make sure it isn’t too close to the litter tray.</p>

<p>Even though your cat is grown, she may still crave milk. Vets are much more concerned with the amount of water, carbohydrates, and proteins consumed by your cat. Cats like milk because it is rich in fat. Just be careful, because both options are high in fat, and you don�t want to feed your kitty too much of that. She won’t be able to digest it without side effects.</p>

<p>If your cranky house cat always acts like they just woke up from a nap, it may be because they did. Cats do not like to eat and drink near where they go to the toilet.
