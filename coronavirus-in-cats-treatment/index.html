According to fox news, the researchers said the cat drugs work by blocking an enzyme on the feline enteric coronavirus so it can’t reproduce and said they could do the same to fight the novel coronavirus in humans. While there are various different strains of coronavirus that affect other species of animals such as dogs, the feline form of the disease is specific to cats, and is not contagious to other species of animals. In a 2016 study, six of eight cats recovered from an infection with the deadly form of the feline coronavirus after treatment with the drug, pedersen and colleagues reported in plos pathogens. Coronavirus that causes diarrhea is simply treated symptomatically using medications and supplements to firm up the stool but coronavirus that causes fip is not able to be treated as easily.</p>

<p>As well as infecting humans, coronaviruses can cause a wide range of diseases in other species including dogs, cats, pigs, cows, mice, bats, birds and ferrets. As yet poorly understood changes in the virus can give rise to mutants that lead to the development of feline infectious peritonitis (fip). It is a common, contagious virus that can be found in the faeces of cats. Being a viral disease, there is no treatment. Treatment, if required, is symptomatic and supportive (ie, fluid therapy, oral electrolyte solutions, antiemetics).</p>

<p>Feline coronavirus and fip in cats note: But thanks to a trove of research on previous coronavirus epidemics, scientists have shown this family of viruses can jump from bats into other species, like civet cats and camels. Feline coronavirus (also sometimes referred to as fcov) is a highly contagious viral condition that is transferred via the faeces of cats. It is a common communicable disease in spaces that coexist or interact with many dogs, especially those with poor sanitary conditions. They block the reproduction of the feline enteric coronavirus that causes peritonitis in cats.</p>

<p>By robert preidt healthday reporter. If you do, many hospitals will send you home. While not all cats who get the coronavirus will develop fip, when it does occur it is a very deadly condition that can be devastating to both the cat and owner. Dogs and cats written by dr. They block the reproduction of the feline enteric coronavirus that causes peritonitis in cats.</p>
