<p>The word ‘tabby’ originates from a striped silk material that is produced near baghdad. According to researchers at uc berkeley, all orange cats are considered tabbies and about 80 percent of all orange tabbies are male, so the majority of these are male orange cat names. Long haired breeds such as persians, maine coons and american curl can have the orange tabby pattern. Nearly all calico cats are female, so they have two x chromosomes. Females have two x chromosomes and so need two copies of this gene to become ginger, whereas males need only one.</p>
