<p>When it comes to meowing, it�s what your cat is doing differently that might matter the most. He does it so much sometimes that he will start to cough a lot. So, if your cat has changed its behavior at all, it is worthwhile to speak with your vet, marsh says. Crying and screeching are the baby’s first form of communication. Let the cat decide, now is not the time to be fussy about where your cat sleeps.</p>

<p>I’m sure you’ll agree that waking in the dead of night to hear your own cat crying like an unhappy infant is an unnerving experience.

<p>I looked out there for a good 30 minutes and couldn�t see anything but he continued to hiss at the window. Free sound effects of a baby crying. Well, this is not an uncommon reaction for baby squirrels as well. They were staring at each other from 2 feets away and making baby crying sounds. Purrs do not always indicate happiness and an unhappy kitty might also purr more as a way to comfort themselves as well.</p>
