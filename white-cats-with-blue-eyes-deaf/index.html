Still, look at it this way: To see if a cat is deaf, try standing a few metres away from them and clapping your hands loudly. Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf.</p>

<p>The easiest way to determine whether or not a cat is an albino is by looking at their eyes. Of white cats with one blue eye, about 40 percent are deaf in at least one ear. There is a relationship between white cats with blue eyes and genetic deafness, though not all cats with this combination will be affected. People ask why white cats with blue eyes are deaf. Coat color and an aspect of the cat’s personality or another aspect of anatomy can be linked if the gene that dictates the cat’s colour and a gene which affects the way the brain develops are situated close together on the same chromosome.</p>

<p>It is a congenital deafness caused by a degeneration of the inner ear. It’s even more of a concern in white cats when they have one or both irises that are blue. Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf. One blue eye, you ask? Reports of this condition date back to at least the 1930s (bamber, 1933), and many investigators have studied it in.</p>

<p>In some cases a completely white cat will have a gene with white spots resulting in “odd eyes” (one blue and the other gold or green). Still, look at it this way: Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears. Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf. Unless both ears are affected, cats may never show any signs of hearing loss.</p>
