<p>Lovecraft story!draw us a picture of what you think any of the characters in this story. The cats of ulthar takes place in the titular fictional town, which is home to an ornery couple who are known to capture and torture stray cats to death. The narrator recalls that in the time before the law was passed, there was an old cotter and his wife who trapped and killed their neighbors� cats. “the town of cats” is as much “from beyond” as ulthar. In the tale, an unnamed narrator relates the story of how a law forbidding the killing of cats came to be in a town called ulthar.</p>

<p>The literary catcast is dedicated to the preservation of vintage books and literature with cats as main characters. I think this is one of hpl�s most successful dunsanian approximations. Lovecraft the setting determines most of the development of the story. Among the villagers one old couple has a reputation to sadistically torture and kill any cat that happens to pass through their farmyard at night. Lovecraft outlined the plot to this story in may 1920, and wrote the short story.</p>

Lovecraft the setting determines most of the development of the story.</p>
