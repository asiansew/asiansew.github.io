<p>Dogs can eat any species of mushroom that people can. A dog’s digestive system may not necessarily agree with mushrooms. While the kinds we find at the grocer are not poisonous to cats, many wild species of mushrooms can be. Cats love having a box of greens to chew on, which adds needed chlorophyll, vitamins and roughage to. Wild mushrooms, unfortunately, may be deadly.</p>

<p>Most of the mushrooms available in the supermarket or your local grocery are safe for your dogs. If the mushroom is safe for you to eat and is on sale at your local grocery store, then it likely is safe for your doggie, too, notes the aspca. Dogs can have mushrooms, but there are only specific types of food that are safe to eat. Yes, puppies can eat grocery store purchased mushrooms. Even then, dogs can eat only a little amounts of mushrooms, large consumption can cause diarrhea and vomiting.</p>

<p>Ninety percent of the mushrooms we eat are this variety. “when it’s young, it looks like the white button mushroom seen in grocery store produce sections.” it can also be confused with the edible shaggy parasol. So, the mushrooms that are safe for humans to eat are safe for dogs as well. However, cats shouldn’t eat wild mushrooms, as they can be poisonous, and mushrooms shouldn’t make up a significant portion of a cat’s diet. Everyone seems to agree that wild mushrooms present too great a risk.</p>
