<p>Cats with down syndrome usually have round eyes opposed to the normal ones having slightly slanted eyes. Why can’t cats have down syndrome? This means, that cats don´t have 21 st chromosome trisomy, but there have been cases of cats having defects at birth, that resemble the symptoms of down´s syndrome in humans. However, cats have 19 pairs of chromosomes, so it’s not possible for them to have down syndrome. People with down syndrome have an extra chromosome that impacts how a person looks and their ability to think, learn, and reason.</p>
