<p>Out of fear of abuse, some animal shelters will not adopt out black cats in the weeks leading up to the holiday, serpell says. The story is that there was a village which didn’t have that many cats generally, and once any cat appeared they considered it bad luck. I don�t know but something is telling my car personally is bad luck.i�ve been having bad luck for a while.but the funny thing is i don�t know if it is him.😂 just curious thanks. Taking care of dental hygiene. For luck, cats were often kept on board ships.</p>

Black cats feature in the superstitions of many countries — but whether they mean good luck or bad varies. The beautiful black cat is usually associated with witches, superstition and bad luck.</p>
