<p>Dogs can safely eat pumpkin with no problems, provided that it is cooked, raw, or canned organic and natural pumpkin and that it is slowly introduced into the dog’s regular diet. Don’t feed your animals raw pumpkin seeds. Avoid any canned pumpkin products that contain added flavoring or sugars, especially if your cat has diabetes. Don’t feed your cats and dogs any part of the stem, as it’s rough on digestive tracts. You can cut it into pieces and leave it out.</p>

<p>Some cats prefer the seeds, and some owners find it easier to crush them and add a little to their food. Don’t feed your pets pumpkin that’s been sitting out for a period of time. Do not add any salt or spices. Mix between one and four teaspoons of canned pumpkin with cat food one to two times a day. Fresh pumpkin that has been baked until soft.</p>
