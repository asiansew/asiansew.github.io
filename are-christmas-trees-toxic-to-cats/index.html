I have heard that they are toxic to cats so i was not a huge fan of having a christmas tree (unless it was a fake christmas tree) but then my other house mate said that he wanted a christmas tree too. One of my cats, not the sharpest tool in the box, never noticed the tree was there till around 12th night!
