So, my cat goes over to my neighbor�s house to play frequently, today there was a note from the lady attached onto his collar, it said to call her. I can barely see the yellow.</p>

<p>Her overall health is good. Vet diagnosed him as having a heart murmur, possibly due to malnutrition as a little one. This condition, called dilated pupils, nearly always means that something is seriously wrong.

<p>Ive got a flame pint boy with big blye eyes whos always squinting n the sun and hispupils ar emuch. I shown a lamp in its face and no reaction almost. One of her eyes dilated the normal way, the other wouldn�t dilate at all. Glaucoma in cats is a disease that involves increased pressure of fluid inside the eye (aqueous humor). In cats, as well as humans,have drainage channels that, if blocked, cause the aqueous humor to accumulate.</p>

<p>I rescued my cat luna about a year and a half ago from a family friend. I can barely see the yellow. You left out that you should also take your cat to the vet right away if you notice that his or her pupils are dialated all the time. This condition, called dilated pupils, nearly always means that something is seriously wrong. Lokidude99as an owner of a pet you will know that they are truly a part of the family, so when you notice anything that is out of the ordinary with them you always tend to worry and think the worst.</p>
