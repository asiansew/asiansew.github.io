<p>Hope this helps a bit. Advocate for cats is supplied in packets of 3 or 6 single use pipettes. I have used advocate on my 2 cats recently as advised by the vet. Advocate is a combined flea and worm spot on treatment that not only kills fleas but also hookworms, roundworms, heartworm and otodectes ear mites. I now have a big patch (about the size of a small plate) what look�s like melted leather didn�t even give it a thought about him been on the sofa as he always get�s up, but forgott about the stuff i put on him, my hubby will kill me</p>

<p>The area is then left to dry, which might take a few hours. I�m going to refer my vets to this site. Other treatments were not effective at that time. Advantage + drontal is reasonable alternative to advocate but will not treat ear mites, sarcoptic mange, heartworm, some lungworm and a couple of other less common parasites. Advocate is a combined flea and worm spot on treatment that not only kills fleas but also hookworms, roundworms, heartworm and otodectes ear mites.</p>

<p>The first couple of times, both cats were �low� for a couple of days, i put it down to sulking. Advocate flea and worm treatment for cats. It is also used to protect against heartworm. It is supplied in packets of 3 or 6 single use pipettes. As it only covers roundworm, they have drontal one every 3 months for the tapeworm.</p>

<p>The area is then left to dry, which might take a few hours. Do not use advocate for large cats (0.8ml) or advocate for dogs (any size), only advocate for small cats and ferrets (0.4 ml) must be used. It is also used to protect against heartworm. Just treat both dog�s with avocate spot on, oscar my older dog has came in from the garden and straight up on the sofa. The content of a full pipette is applied onto the animal’s skin, after parting the fur.</p>

<p>Sorry for resurrecting an old thread, but i�ve just been to the vet to get advocate for my two cats, and they charged me £50 for 6 vials (3 months supply). Approved third parties also use these tools in connection with our display of ads. Can also be used to treat mange, ear mites and as part of a treatment strategy for flea allergy dermatitis (fad). Sorry for resurrecting an old thread, but i�ve just been to the vet to get advocate for my two cats, and they charged me £50 for 6 vials (3 months supply). Advocate is for dogs who are suffering or are at risk from internal and external parasitic infections.</p>
