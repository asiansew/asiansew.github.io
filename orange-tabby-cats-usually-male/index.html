<p>Your first statement is incorrect. Fun ginger tabby cat coat fact: This is a really interesting fact and it tells us that sex and coat color genetics are somehow related, at least in orange cats. This is because the gene for the orange color is sex linked meaning it�s only present on the x chromosome. This is because when cats of a certain color get together, the females will often present with tortishell markings.</p>

<p>It’s a disease that can occur in both male and female cats. Orange tabby cats are almost all male. This is because when cats of a certain color get together, the females will often present with tortishell markings. Males only have to inherit one orange gene to appear orange, while females have to inherit two. The gene that codes for orange fur is on the x chromosome.</p>

<p>This certainly seems to point to some genetic link between sex and coat markings, although veterinarians and researchers still haven’t seemed to pinpoint the exact factors. Orange tabby cats are almost usually male. Orange cats have been part of popular culture for a long time, from garfield the. In comparison, female ginger tabbies have been reported as being “flighty”—so it seems that not all ginger tabby cats are known for their calm disposition. It’s a disease that can occur in both male and female cats.</p>
