<p>Mimicry is a common behavior when there is a need to deter opponents in the animal world, and it seems cats learned from the best; A hissing cat does sound like a snake. Growling, hissing or spitting indicate a cat who is annoyed, frightened, angry or aggressive. Some experts in feline behavior believe that cats actually developed this habit by imitating snakes. For example, if a new and strange cat shows up on a cat�s designated turf, he may instantly begin to hiss as a defensive and territorial instinct. Common reasons why cats hiss.</p>

<p>This is a way of cats showing their possessiveness or protectiveness. If they do make any noises, you are more likely to hear a meow than a hiss or growl. Stinkerbelle seems to be most likely to growl at essie, essie responds by becoming aggressive, mukluk will hiss if the other cats get aggressive, but she does not seem to start things). A growling cat can be a warning. Even if your cat is the sweetest little cat on the planet, if she has ever felt threatened or needed to send a warning to someone (feline, canine or human), she has probably hissed at some point.</p>
