Since the cat eye color can play a huge role in the hearing abilities of a cat, finding out the cause of your cat’s hearing problem may help you address the issue before it gets worse. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises. When one or both eyes are blue, anywhere from 60% to 80% of white cats will be deaf. Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears.</p>

<p>While there is a clear correlation between the blue eye color and deafness in white cats, why is this so? Cats with blue eyes can sometimes have visual or auditory deficiencies. Some of these cats are deaf in only one ear. A white cat with both eyes that are blue are deaf. And in addition to rio�s sweetie:</p>

<p>Also, a cat could be deaf from birth for reasons other than the white coat/blue eye combo. A white cat with one blue eye has a 39% chance of at least partial deafness, and a white cat with two blue eyes may have a 65% chance. And in addition to rio�s sweetie: Usually, not always the side with the blue eye is the deaf eye. Since the cat eye color can play a huge role in the hearing abilities of a cat, finding out the cause of your cat’s hearing problem may help you address the issue before it gets worse.</p>

<p>The condition most commonly affects white cats, but may be found in a cat of any color, provided that it possesses the white spotting gene. Furthermore, if a cat has one blue eye and one green, the ear on the side of the blue eye is more likely to be deaf than the other. You can help a deaf cat lead a happy, full life by keeping it protected indoors and learning to use visual signals and vibrations to communicate. It�s also best to keep a partially deaf or fully deaf cat indoors at all. A cat with a gene with white spots (like the tuxedo cat) can have blue eyes or in some cases odd eyes.</p>
