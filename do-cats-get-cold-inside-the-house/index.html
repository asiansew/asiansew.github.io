<p>Can still get quite cold in the winter. When the thermometer dips below freezing, it is important to protect your cats from the cold spell. This is due to a few factors but primarily your cat’s coat. It can’t get at our cats but perhaps one of them doesn’t believe that. (inside a lower unheated part of the house), and that was probably risky.</p>

<p>Cold weather can be hard on cats, just like it can be hard on people. Especially if the owner out and the heating is switched off If you have an indoor cat, then you do not have to worry too much about trying to keep your cat warm. Speaking of the heating pads, what i did to get my cats to use them was to buy a few yards of fleece from the fabric store and make a donut around the pad with the fleece. Probably the best prescription for winter�s woes is to keep your cat inside with you and your family.</p>
