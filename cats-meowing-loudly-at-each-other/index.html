<p>Other male cats too and this is why litters can contain kittens with different fathers and so look very different from each other. Domestic cats that have been around humans for a long time may occasionally meow at each other, but this is usually in the presence of humans and is never their primary means of communication. They also meow to say hello, or in protest when you leave. The chirr or chirrup sounds like a meow rolled on the tongue. They weren�t hissing or growling or anything just meowing extremely loudly.</p>

<p>Sometimes, meowing is simply their way of welcoming their human home. This can be loud and is known as caterwauling. Both female and male cats that have not been neutered or spayed yowl when they are sexually mature to indicate an urge to mate. Meowing is like talking for cats it is normal behaviour but adult cats don�t meow to each other but only at people and fore the kitten they meow just to inform their mother of their situation if they are hungry cold or lost but when they get a bit older they to stop mewling at other cats. Cats who live indoors and outdoors may meow to get you to open a door.</p>

<p>Other big cats usually grumble, howl, hiss, and even cough and grunt. Purring does not always mean that the cat is happy; Meowing means pay attention to me. broadly speaking, cats meow to let you know they�re sick, want want some playtime or petting time, they�re hungry, they�re lonely or they�re stressed. Kittens meow to let their mother know they’re cold or hungry, but once they get a bit older, cats no longer meow to other cats. So it is probably that.</p>
