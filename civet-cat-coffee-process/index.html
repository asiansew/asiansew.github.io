Allowing the civet cat to roam wild and free, this company supports, and is guided by, the ethos of authentic civet coffee certification bodies. It has been proven that this special coffee has medicinal properties as well.</p>

<p>Civet coffee has more to do with the process it goes through, although many people prefer the flavor when it’s made from excreted arabica beans. Civet coffee has more to do with the process it goes through, although many people prefer the flavor when it�s made from excreted arabica beans. During the digestion process, the bitterness of the coffee is removed. However, its processing is very unusual. But how can the digestion process affect the coffee beans and dramatically improve their flavor?</p>

<p>The type of coffee depends on the variety of beans the civet eats. Civet coffee has as everything to do with the fact that the beans came out a civet cat’s behind. After about 24 hours, the coffee beans are defecated by the civet cats. It may feed on beans from the arabica coffee plant, the robusta, or any other coffee plant available to it. As long as some critter helped the fermentation process along, the coffee gets labeled kopi luwak.</p>

<p>The coffee separated from its faeces is processed to make the kopi luwak. During the digestive process the coffee cherries and the pulp are removed but the coffee beans aren�t digested. During this process some kind of unique fermentation occurs which is responsible for giving the civet coffee its special flavor. Civet coffee beans, as mentioned, used to be picked from the poop of civet animals who were wild and free. During this process, the enzymes found in the civet’s stomach alter the flavour of the bean, making it richer, smoother, and more earthy with chocolate.</p>
