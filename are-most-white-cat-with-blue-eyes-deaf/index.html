The w gene responsible for white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and presence of a blue eye can indicate the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. The most common example of genes affecting both colors is white skin / blue eyes.</p>

<p>When one or both eyes are blue, anywhere from 60% to 80% of white cats will be deaf. According to international cat care: In fact, albino cats usually have light blue eyes and extremely white fur as they have no melanin and therefore no color. Black and white cats with blue eyes have a much more common type of hearing and vision problem that may be related to their eye color. However, this isn�t common in cats.</p>

<p>No doubt blue feline eyes have charm, and every cat owner wants that pearl in her house. In one 1997 study of white cats, 72% of the animals were found to be totally deaf. No doubt blue feline eyes have charm, and every cat owner wants that pearl in her house. There is a relationship between white cats with blue eyes and genetic deafness, though not all cats with this combination will be affected. About half of all white cats are deaf, and those numbers increase in cats with blue eyes, with deafness often found on the same side as the blue eye — left blue eye, deaf in left ear;</p>
