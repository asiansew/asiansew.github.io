<p>A bristled tail indicates aggression and fear, a twitching tail indicates mild irritation, and a fully erect tail is a sign of greeting. A cat flicking the end of their tail, for example, is excited or happy. Cats communicate with a number of different movements. Unless they have been injured, almost all cats wag their tails. There are a few theories about this;</p>

<p>This could be a threat or a sign of trust. You might even notice them twitching their tails, whiskers, ears, and paws. In other words, if you are petting your cat and they start thrashing their tail, they are trying to tell you to stop. So, it should come as no surprise that cats wag their tails for a variety of reasons, and it sometimes takes a little detective work to figure out what they are trying to tell us. I used to know the answer, and i know they do it for a few different reasons, but i cant remember what!</p>
