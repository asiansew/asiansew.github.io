<p>For generations, four clans of wild cats have shared the forest according to the laws laid down by their ancestors. But the warrior code has been threatened, and the thunderclan cats are in grave danger. The series is primarily set in the fictional location of white hart woods, and, later, sanctuary lake. As of january 2019, over 40 million books have been sold.3 this is the fifth arc of warriors.the series revolves around the time prior to and of the origin of the five. I have a great idea for a new series.</p>
