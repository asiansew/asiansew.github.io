<p>There is no short yes or no answer as to whether cats can eat strawberries. They are ok and not poisonous to cats and dogs. This means you may wish to offer tart, unripened strawberries to a cat. According to aspca (american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals), this refreshing fruit is not toxic to cats.however, there are still some important things to consider when offering your cat this amazing treat. Can cats eat strawberry yogurt?</p>

<p>However, can also potentially have an effect on a cat�s fitness. Most cats will not eat strawberries, even if you give it to them, because they do not like the sweet taste of them. People who were little girls back in the 80�s might remember a little (highly merchandised) character named strawberry shortcake who lived in a giant strawberry shaped house and had a little pink cat with white polka dots named custard. Sweet, sour and tasty “ichigo”. Strawberries are rich in vitamins, so they are delicious for people and cats.</p>
