They have the wonderful russian blue personality along with the great quality of being hypoallergenic as i personally have cat allergies and these beautiful cats do not cause a problem. This cat breed produces less fel d 1 glycoprotein, a secretoglobin protein that is produced in a cat’s sebaceous glands and saliva and is the primary allergen in cats and kittens.</p>

<p>It’s the perfect camouflage, blending into dark furnishings and shadowy corners. Their coat gives them an elegant appearance that is distinctly their own. Then you may have already heard the myth that russian blue cats are hypoallergenic. They cannot pull their tail or annoy them. The cat staged its first public appearance in 1871, when a russian blue was displayed at the crystal palace in london, under the name archangel cat.</p>

<p>The primary cause of allergies to cats is a glycoprotein known as fel d1 which is produced by the sebaceous glands under the skin, and to a lesser degree is present in the cat’s saliva. Russian blue cats get along with dogs and other cats in the house as well. This coat makes the russian blue one of the first cats brought up when someone mentions they are allergic to cats but they or a family member would still like a feline companion. They have the wonderful russian blue personality along with the great quality of being hypoallergenic as i personally have cat allergies and these beautiful cats do not cause a problem. The russian blue cat’s personality is rarely unpredictable or aggressive.</p>

<p>The russian blue is quite an old feline breed that descends from cats native to the current, and former, country of russia. Are russian blue cats good for allergies? My husband is a huge cat lover, but i�m allergic! (not severely, but enough to be uncomfortable if living with a cat) i did some research and i found that russian blues are hypoallergenic. Russian blue cats produce less glycoprotein fel d 1 than other cat breeds.</p>
