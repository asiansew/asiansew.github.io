<p>When unequal pupils occur, the abnormal eye can be either the smaller (constricted) pupil or the larger (dilated) pupil. Meaning, the eyes unintentionally move or swing back and forth. Cats die with their eyes open. Glaucoma is another common cause for differing pupil size in cats. Pain also can be indicated either by a constricting or dilating of your cat�s pupils.</p>

<p>Also, squinting behavior and bloodshot eyes are indicators of pain in cats. Cats usually have some variety of green, yellow, or blue eyes. It takes active muscle control to close the eyes. This means that in the early stages of illness, often the only thing that a cat owner may notice is that the cat has become quiet and withdrawn. Pain in the eyes themselves is usually accompanied by the constricting of a cat�s pupils, while pain elsewhere in the body can be accompanied by dilated pupils.</p>
