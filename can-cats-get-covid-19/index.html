<p>A tiger at a zoo in new york has also tested positive for the virus. Many studies have been done to learn more about how this virus can affect different animals. There is no evidence that pets or other domestic animals are able to transmit the virus to people. Of the pets that have gotten sick, most only had mild illness and fully recovered. However, as it is known that the virus can survive on surfaces such as door handles, it may be possible, despite the lack of evidence, for the virus to survive in a similar way on a cat’s.</p>
