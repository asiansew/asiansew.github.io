<p>Cats most commonly contract worms after coming into contact with parasite eggs or infected feces. Roundworms, tapeworms and other parasites can spread to humans, so keep children away from litter boxes and wash their hands after contact with the cat. However, heavy burdens of worms can cause weight loss, vomiting and diarrhoea, irritation around the anus and failure to thrive. Cats can easily get roundworms by ingesting rodents infected by this worm or by getting exposed to feces of other infected felines. For this reason, outdoor cats are far more likely to suffer from worms.</p>

<p>Some worms can cause damage really fast, so every week may make a difference in the outcome. Cats can pick up eggs from the grass or the soil they come in contact with or simply by ingesting them. For example, an outside cat might eat a rodent that’s infected and will then get the same worm. Let’s start with the most common parasite worms in your cats: The most common worms cats can get are tapeworms, hookworms, roundworms, lungworms, whipworms, and heartworms.</p>

<p>I feel the best way to remember these different types is to describe them visually or from how they affect your cat. Take care that your cat doesn ’t eat anything dirty like trash or might have been contaminated by another animal. Some worms can cause damage really fast, so every week may make a difference in the outcome. First, let’s consider what exactly worms are and why you should be concerned if your cat has them.
