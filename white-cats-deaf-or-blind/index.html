<p>The reason, as you may have guessed, is heredity: Deafness in white cats at a glance. How will i know if my cat is deaf? 2 cats with white coats and blue eyes are highly likely to be deaf in one or both ears. The easiest way to determine whether or not a cat is an albino is by looking at their eyes.</p>

<p>But if the white cat has any other color of eyes, or if it has one blue eye and one eye that is not blue, then they usually are not deaf. Interestingly, if a white cat with one blue eye is deaf in. The reason, as you may have guessed, is heredity: And so it also means that those cats who i called were not deaf either. A deaf cat�s meows are often much louder than those of a nondeaf cat as well because it doesn�t know it�s deaf and can�t control the volume of its voice.</p>
