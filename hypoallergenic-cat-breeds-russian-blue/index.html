Both breeds are considered hypoallergenic cats and are said to feel as velvety soft as rex rabbits, hence the name! This hypoallergenic cat lives for 12 to 15 years. Russian blues have a short, dense coat which tends to shed less and produce less fel d1 than other.</p>

<p>Yes, it has a stunning long coat, but just like the russian blue and balinese, this cat’s skin produces less fel d1 than most other breeds and that’s why it is considered hypoallergenic. If you’re looking for a lean, elegant, smart cat, the russian blue is for you. In texture the coat of the russian blue cat is very different from any other breed and is the truest measure of the breed. Is the russian blue truly hypoallergenic? Some feline breeds exist that are considered low allergy or hypoallergenic cats.</p>

<p>They have thick, furry coats, but they don’t produce as much of an allergen called glycoprotein fel d 1 that most other cats produce, which helps make them hypoallergenic. There is evidence that russian blues produce less of the glycoprotein fel d 1 which is as we’ve said is one of the most common allergens of cats. They still produce a small amount, however, which can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the person. Russian blue is a hypoallergenic cat but it is not only the coat of the russian blue that makes it good from an allergies perspective. They are very active but not too vocal.</p>

<p>And with their elegant strides and shimmering emerald eyes, these cats make amazing pets. While there�s no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic cat, some breeds have lower levels of dander and less of a protein in their saliva that triggers the allergic reaction. Russian blues have a short, dense coat which tends to shed less and produce less fel d1 than other. They are very active but not too vocal. One of the oldest domestic breeds of cat, the russian blue is a quiet, devoted breed of cat who loves to be close to their human companion.</p>
