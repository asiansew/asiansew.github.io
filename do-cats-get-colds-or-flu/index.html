<p>That cats are susceptible to the virus is a relatively recent discovery, so not all veterinarians are aware of this fact or that human beings can transmit the flu to cats. Some healthy cats can even carry viral bacteria without suffering from the flu or a cold. Other symptoms include aches and pains in the muscles and joints, mouth ulcers, dribbling, sneezing, loss of voice and fever. It gets transmitted via eye discharge, saliva droplets, and sneezing. In humans, colds are typically a result of a virus or bacterial infection.</p>

<p>Cat flu, however, does give cats the same side effects as us. So, make sure that you wash your hands before you have any contact with your pet. Also, if i were to get another kitten, would this raise the chance of the cat i have now catching anything. Cat colds or flu can be caused by a number of viruses or bacteria, the most common are the feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus, and chlamydia. Cats of all ages are susceptible, but young and old kitties are particularly vulnerable because their immune systems are not as strong as cats in their prime.</p>
