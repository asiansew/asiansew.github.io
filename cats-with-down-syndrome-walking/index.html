<p>But this doesn�t mean that down syndrome is an actual disorder among animals. Humans have 23 chromosomes, and it’s an extra copy of a chromosome in the 21st pair which causes down syndrome. Usually, it is a broad nose, eyes set widely apart, or small and odd ears. It looks like down syndrome. According to a research article in the american journal of veterinary research published in 1975, state male cats can have a rare chromosomal abnormality because an additional chromosome produces a disorder.</p>

<p>The injury may be sudden and the result of a trauma such as a car accident or other major impact or after landing from a jump from an extended height, or it may be due to repetitive use of the joint causing minor ligament damage over time that has a cumulative effect.

The injury may be sudden and the result of a trauma such as a car accident or other major impact or after landing from a jump from an extended height, or it may be due to repetitive use of the joint causing minor ligament damage over time that has a cumulative effect.
