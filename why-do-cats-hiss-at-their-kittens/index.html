<p>So, if you notice your cat hissing at you, it is giving you a warning that it is ready to attack if necessary. Two cats who haven’t been properly introduced yet may hiss at one another as a way to say “stay away from me!” Your ‘old’ cat, the one that. All cat owners have experienced the hiss of their cat at some point (probably more than once). This can happen in the following situations:</p>

<p>It�s really upsetting to me. That’s why cats use hissing sounds to warn the “opponent” or “threat” to back off. They are almost 4 months now and she growls and hisses at them. The simple answer is that this is a warning hiss. This is evidenced by jumpy behavior when something or someone closes the cat’s path and he didn’t see them approaching.</p>

<p>But if they feel backed into a corner or unable to avoid the aggressor, cats will often hiss and swat to keep them from coming closer. For example, my neighbors had a kitten that started coming to my house. A hissing cat does sound like a snake. So, while all cats have their own unique personalities and quirky behaviors, i have no doubts you can create a harmonious home for everyone with a little time and attention to their needs. Primarily, mothers hiss so that kittens can learn to mimic the sound.</p>

<p>Cats that truly feel threatened will fluff up and arch their backs, but they don’t jump sideways towards the threat. This vulnerability means a safe nest is essential for the safety of the. When cats are scared they may also arch their back, stand sideways, and pouf up their tail. Mother cats hiss at their kittens for a few different reasons. My neighbor was not happy about it, but the little one was very stubborn and practically invited itself into my home.</p>
