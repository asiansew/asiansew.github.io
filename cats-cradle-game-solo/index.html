<p>Variations of the game have been played for hundreds of years in many cultures. You can keep it going indefinitely too — provided you don’t make a mistake! Bokonon, the founder of the religion, warns that. The aim of the game is that each player must make one alteration of the other player�s string figure to form another string figure. Great for solo fun, but also suitable to play with a friend.</p>

<p>It requires two people to pass the string back and forth to make your string figure. There�s a problem loading this menu right now. The string games, which have evocative names like three diamonds, the celtic knot, and the butterfly, are organized. Detailed instructions for use and care are included. The figure is difficult to do quickly in one smooth motion, so competing to see who can do it the fastest is a fun game to play.</p>

<p>If you never learned to make a jacob�s ladder string figure as a kid, it�s not too late! The shapes are similar and you can keep playing it indefinitely unles. “cat’s cradle” is a simple sequence game played with a looped length of string. After each figure, the next player manipulates that figure and removes the string figure from the hands of the previous player with one of a few simple motions and tightens the loop. It requires two people to pass the string back and forth to make your string figure.</p>
