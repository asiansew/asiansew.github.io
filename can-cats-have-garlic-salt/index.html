<p>This compoung can, in large doses , cause oxidative damage to red blood cells, creating heinz bodies and triggering the body to reject these cells from the bloodstream. However, there are many other chemical compounds containing sodium that are also “salts” that must be kept away from your cat because they are very poisonous. If your cat likes to drink from cups of lick the sides of glasses in the sink, be sure to wash and put away any cups that we used to drink smoothies containing garlic. Although cats have a good tolerance for an extra amount of salt. I went so far as to contact the company that makes this.</p>

<p>This would never be a healthy diet for your cat and thus your cat would require a lot more water than usual if they had salami. Garlic is really not something that you should treat your cat to if you can help it. Hi all, so recently i purchased a cat supplement powder for my boy pookie. Which can have onions, garlic and. Any cat with kidney issues can go severely downhill if onion is in it�s diet.</p>

<p>Cats shouldn�t really get the yeast/garlic mix. Although cats have a good tolerance for an extra amount of salt. Even if you gave them a salted super pretzel , they’d probably be okay. Hi all, so recently i purchased a cat supplement powder for my boy pookie. Spices can give your food that extra oomph.</p>
