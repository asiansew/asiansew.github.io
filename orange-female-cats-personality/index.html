<p>Only about two out of 10 orange cats are female, so if you have an orange girl cat, consider yourself blessed with an extra special pet! These are both nicknames that derive solely from the color of the cat, and it’s no wonder that these names were chosen. The orange color of these cats is very distinct and very noticeable. This means that there are more male cats with orange fur than female cats. Some famous gingers in history.</p>

<p>Like being stroked, but dislike being picked up and cuddled.” a 1973 book published by pedigree foods described ginger tabbies as “quiet, docile and affectionate.” in a recent study at the university of california, cat owners were asked to attribute personality traits to their cats. In addition to being a real purr machine, momo the orange tabby cat seeks affection every waking. Many breeds with orange coats are rather sweet and affectionate, but before we meet these cats, we should talk about the difference between tabby’s and cat breeds with orange coats or any color coat for that matter … Orange tabbies have reddish hair and striped markings. Females have two x chromosomes and so need two copies of this gene to become ginger, whereas males need only one.</p>
