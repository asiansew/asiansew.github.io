<p>Siamese cats have a short, fine coat that comes in four colors: It is an exceptional trait of the lynx point siamese cats that they shed at a low rate. Two feline associations recognize this beauty. Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva. A seal point is genetically a black cat.</p>

<p>Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva. I.e., the face, ears, feet and tail. Siamese cats tend to darken with age, and generally, adult siamese living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cool climates. The birman, himalayan, persian breeds are the least reactive breeds as a whole in my opnion. Are lynx point siamese cats purebred?</p>
