<p>He may begin to drool almost instantly, pawing at the outside of his mouth and showing signs of oral irritation. I guess the cat myth is getting kind of stale, so someone has started arguing that they are indeed toxic to rabbits. The poisonous part of the plant is the milky white sap found inside leaves and flowers. Keep reading to learn about the signs and treatment of poinsettia poisoning in pets. As for cats, it can be a little harmful, but not fatal.</p>

<p>The poinsettia ( euphorbia pulcherrima) is a popular plant to display over the christmas period. He may begin to drool almost instantly, pawing at the outside of his mouth and showing signs of oral irritation. Poinsettias are commonly recognized as a holiday plant with their beautiful, crimson red leaves that scream christmas cheer. The history of the poinsettia has led to a lot of misinformation about this plant. Cat owners should know that carnations are toxic to cats, dogs and horses.</p>

<p>1 poinsettias are not severely toxic, but eating them can make your cat drool, vomit, or have diarrhea. We have a 3 year old female siamese mix cat that’s about 10 pounds. Would have to eat over 500 poinsettia leaves to reach an even potentially toxic dose of compounds in the poinsettia plant. The milky white sap on the leaves actually tastes bitter and irritating to your cat: If there is any sap on your dog&amp;rsquo;s exterior, he will decontaminate the dog by flushing with water and using a mild detergent to wash the dog.</p>
