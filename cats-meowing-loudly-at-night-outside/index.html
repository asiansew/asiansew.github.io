<p>Superstition, why cats cry at night, how to stop excessive cat meowing at night having you cat crying at night doesn’t auger well with your need to rest after a hectic day. I know that might sound weird but listen. This common feline behaviour can occur because of a cat’s natural instincts, because of other factors at play, or both.

<p>But the cats meowing loudly is mainly towards humans. They can be entertained by birds, people walking by, and random leaves blowing in the wind. Cats don�t like to step on it. That’s a tough call to make, as it’s really a personal issue. I left it some cooked chicken in a bowl but had to shoo away the neighbors cat that was trying to eat the food!</p>
