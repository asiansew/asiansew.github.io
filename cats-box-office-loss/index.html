<p>Why cats� movie reviews are so negative according to deadline, cats is tracking to lose $71 million at the global box office, that is if the film reaches a global box office result of $100m, with $40m stateside and $60m abroad. this projection is based on a $90 million budget and $115 million towards advertising.currently, cats sits at $17 million in the u.s. Reports suggest that thus far, cats has only pulled in around $38 million (£28.9 million) globally. The film, based on the musical by andrew lloyd webber, hit cinemas on december 20. In the film and media industry, if a film released in theatres fails to break even by a large amount, it is considered a box office bomb (or box office flop), thus losing money for the distributor, studio, and/or production company that invested in it. It�s not alone in december financial failures just the biggest of the bunch.</p>
