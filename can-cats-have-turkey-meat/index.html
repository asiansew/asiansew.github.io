<p>Can cats have turkey gravy? In this situation you would add approximately 1/8 of a cup as organ meat and the rest as muscle meat. Ground beef is cheap, easy to prepare and easy for cats to digest. I feed my cats table foods from time to time just make sure it is within reason. Yes, plain turkey (no salt, seasonings, butter, onions, or garlic) that has not been fried is safe for your dog.</p>

<p>While it may have gotten a bad rap over the years due to some confusion about which part of the turkey is safe to feed to pets, turkey is perfectly safe for dogs to eat (with some exceptions). In the case of liver, there can be too much of a good thing. Taurine is an essential amino acid. A lot of people who have cats worry about not providing their cats with enough taurine. Remove uneaten turkey after 20 minutes.</p>

<p>In the case of liver, there can be too much of a good thing. As obligate carnivores, meat should form the majority of a cat’s diet. This staple of thanksgiving happens to be completely edible and delicious for felines. Taurine is an essential amino acid. I do know a lot of people with kitty cats, though!</p>
