<p>A cat�s eyes are very expressive and can tell you a lot about her mood and health. You may notice your cat is uncomfortable coming into a dark room. My cat eyes are always round or dilated since birth. And they look kind of blue around the outside of the pupil. There may or may not be other symptoms present.</p>

<p>I am wondering why her pupils are dilated in light as well as dark conditions. Both pupils should be equal in size, and when looked at with a bright light, they should both constrict quickly. And they look kind of blue around the outside of the pupil. To evaluate the eyes and pancreas for signs of inflammation or tumours. A siamese show cat will be disqualified if he does not have blue eyes.</p>

<p>I am wondering why her pupils are dilated in light as well as dark conditions. If you notice changes in your cat�s iris or the appearance of splotches of other colors, contact your vet. Sometimes dilated pupils can be a signal that something�s not quite right. They never change they stay round day and night. If unequal pupils occur suddenly, bring your cat to a veterinary clinic or animal hospital immediately as eyesight can be permanently damaged if the problem is not rectified.</p>

<p>And they look kind of blue around the outside of the pupil. Nystagmus causes the eyes to unintentionally move or swing back and forth and can occur in both dogs and cats and is a characteristic sign of a problem in the animal�s nervous system. The blue eye colour is linked to the coat, which is the siamese pattern or colourpoint. Either because their pupils are always somewhat wider or because their pupils, once dilated, are slow to. When frisky is very playful or feeling stressed, her pupils can become very large to reflect her feelings.</p>
