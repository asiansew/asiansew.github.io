<p>We breed beautiful brown, and snow spotted/rosetted bengals kittens , from our top quality pedigree bengal cats. One of the most frequent questions we get from people is whether or not bengal cats are hypoallergenic? It means there’s is a less likely chance of getting an allergic reaction. Bengals have a wild appearance; Technically however, there really are no domestic cats that are 100% hypoallergenic.</p>

<p>Bengals are called hypoallergenic because they produce lower allergens than other cats (produce less of fel d1 protein than others). And their uniqueness is not just limited to their look. Bengal cats and bengal kittens in the houston area. Alc, eg, sbt and more. This cat breed grooms themselves less frequently than most cat breeds.</p>

<p>Since fel d 1 allergen is secreted mostly in a cat’s saliva, this means that bengal cats have less allergen on their fur. An important thing to keep in mind is that although they are hypoallergenic, this doesn’t mean allergy free. However, if you have cat allergies, don’t assume that you will have no allergic reaction to a bengal. All cats produce this protein to some degree, so all cats are somewhat allergenic. Bengal cats are considered to be hypoallergenic cats, which means they tend to cause less allergic reactions than many other breeds of cats.</p>
