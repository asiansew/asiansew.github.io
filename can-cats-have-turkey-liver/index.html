<p>Cats and dogs should not ever be given these meats: But a steady diet of tuna prepared for humans can lead to malnutrition because it won�t have all the nutrients a cat needs. In the wild, cats would have eaten the liver of their prey. On the other hand, liver excels at providing vitamin a, vitamin k, iron, and phosphorus, and kidneys can provide high levels of vitamin a, vitamin c, vitamin d, calcium, iron, phosphorus, and sodium. It�s only when liver is in cat food that she gets sick, or when the liver isn�t cooked (raw doesn�t work).</p>

<p>For most cats, that is. If your dog or cat is not typically raw fed, i wouldn’t recommend starting with raw liver. As far as being healthy, turkey liver is very high in vitamin a. However, do not in any way give them uncooked turkey meat as it will increase the risk for them to contract salmonella. It may be infected with parasites or toxins that could make the liver unsafe for your dog.</p>
