If your cat isn’t a fan of apples please don’t take it upon yourself to force them to eat the fruit. Digestion in all mammals works by the release of enzymes which break the food down. Apples especially can be fed to cats however should be in minimal amounts. If your cat sees you eating apple slice, she may get curious and want to give it a try.</p>

<p>The answer is yes, cats can eat apples. Yes, cats love to eat human foods but you can’t give them what you eat. Strangely enough, cats aren’t one of these creatures. However, this does not mean that cats don’t eat fruits. High in calcium, vitamin k, vitamin c and what is called pectin, (an easily soluble fibre), there is plenty of nutritional value in the average apple.</p>
