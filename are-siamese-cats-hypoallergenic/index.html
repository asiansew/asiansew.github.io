Siamese are incredibly long and skinny like a supermodel with incredibly beautiful shaped blue eyes that are the most striking characteristic of siamese cats. Indeed, looking online, it seems some cats are actively being promoted as being hypoallergenic but the problem with this is similar to the old chinese whispers.
