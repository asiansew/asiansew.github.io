<p>It’s best if you can simply puree an apple up yourself. Applesauce bought at your local supermarket is usually artificial and contains many preservatives and chemicals which could harm your car. Wouldn’t it better to feed your cat something healthy? It is one of the foods cats can eat. Thing is, even though apples are a great treat or snack for humans, they can be fairly unsafe for cats to eat.</p>

<p>Apple seeds are known to contain the chemical amygdalin. It is one of the foods cats can eat. One of my cats has a sweet tooth as well, so i do understand the temptation. There are still pesticides in applesauce that is from the larger brands that humans consume. Cats can eat apples in small slices.</p>
