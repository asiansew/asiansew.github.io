<p>This probably won’t come as a great shock to the cat, queen said, because he or she has probably been turned out of bed previously for “making biscuits on you when you’re trying to sleep.” Scout showing off one of his unique kitten talents…we call it making biscuits.

Scout was transfixed, watching the dogs and their handlers glide across the floor.</p>
