<p>Other cats that are normally vocal may become quiet, while quiet. I�ve seen a few videos of cats of this breed that snore, but it doesn�t seem too bad. Some common brachycephalic breeds include burmese, exotic shorthairs, himalayans, persians, and scottish folds. These are very audible indications that your cat may be unhappy. Ever since my aunt got the first ragdoll cat in our family, i have loved the breed.</p>

<p>He�ll get into the garbage to do it. Cats who sleep in a strange position, which interferes with their breathing, may snore when asleep. Overweight cats have a higher tendency to snore. Purrs do not always indicate happiness and an unhappy kitty might also purr more as a way to comfort themselves as well. Hopefully the breathing issue is exaggerated, but it does make me question getting this breed.</p>

<p>Also, since there is a tremendous loss of appetite and lack of water content in the body, your kitty will grow thinner and thinner while getting closer to death. While this is not likely to be an immediate health concern, obesity can lead to many other serious health conditions. Your cat may meow more or less than usual. In fact, this cat is so healthy you’ll very likely never require a trip to the vet other than to show up for annual visits or specialty appointments that you. There is a charge for the service if you choose to connect to a veterinarian.</p>
