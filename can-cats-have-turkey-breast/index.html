<p>On thanksgiving, you will also need to watch the stuffing as it often contains many seasonings and ingredients that are harmful to cats. Salt comes in large quantities usually and too much of it can poison your cat. Chicken and rice can never replace the balanced nutrition provided by specialist cat food. Can cats have raw chicken? Duck meat is also safe but is higher in fat, so it should be fed more sparingly.</p>

<p>Cooked turkey bones can splinter and pose a great danger to your cat. The short answer is “yes and no.” turkey is not toxic to dogs. Turkey makes a good occasional snack and can also be added to your cat’s wet food to make it more palatable. Just as long as it�s only a treat occasionally. Many pets enjoy the flavor, aroma, and texture of this popular meat.</p>
