I also found a different vet who was more knowledgeable with kidney disease. Researchers cannot say for sure why cats develop it, but other medical issues can lead to kidney disease, such as an infection, a virus, gum disease, and dehydration.</p>

<p>The iris classification , international renal interest society, consists in four stages, each with their own characteristics and some recommendations for treatment. Acute renal failure develops suddenly, over a matter of days or weeks. Researchers cannot say for sure why cats develop it, but other medical issues can lead to kidney disease, such as an infection, a virus, gum disease, and dehydration. As cats get closer to death the symptoms become much more severe. We went through this recently.</p>

<p>The journal of veterinary internal medicine reviewed 132 cases of acute feline kidney failure. End stage feline kidney disease how to help the cat. But as most of this club’s members will attest, getting a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease doesn’t have to be a tragedy. I adopted my cat at age 14 and she was in stage 3 kidney failure. Kidney failure is that common.</p>
