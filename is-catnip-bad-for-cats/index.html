<p>Cats are unique in their response to catnip, as cats have a special receptor for the catnip active ingredient, called nepetalactone. He does mention that catnip sometimes makes cats aggressive, though. Although catnip is considered safe for cats it is important that you do not overfeed your cat catnip. But the cats that luckily do are in fact reacting to the active compound found in catnip’s essential oils called nepetalactone, a naturally occurring active compound you can read more about here. Catnip effects vary, and some cats don’t react at all.</p>

<p>Catnip effects vary, and some cats don’t react at all. (“no, kitty, that�s a bad kitty!”) cats love the smell of catnip, but is it ok for them to eat it? In some cases, it is not the catnip you need to worry about, but the toy itself. Several studies have shown that catnip affects nearly every feline species, not just domestic cats. Catnip does not appear to have an impact on dietary trials for allergies.</p>

<p>Catnip gets its name from the way cats react to it. Also, 10 percent to 30 percent of the cat population does not respond to catnip at all, at any age. Some cats on catnip become loving, while others may become seemingly more “aggressive” says dr. It’s found to be neither toxic nor addictive, so you can freely use it as a reward or training aid.
