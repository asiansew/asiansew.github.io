<p>Harry based the song off a poem written by his wife sandy chapin. Has anyone ever encountered someone who thinks the song cats in the cradle was performed by cat stevens? Through all the pain as a teenager, i felt comforted by the song as it was a warning to my dad that if he continued to be distant emotionally, then one day i would not have time for him. And the cat�s in the cradle and the silver spoon little boy blue and the man on the moon when you comin� home, dad i don�t know when, but we�ll get together then you know we�ll have a good time then well, he came from college just the other day so much like a man i just had to say son, i�m proud of you, can you sit for a while I�m not aware of any deep meaning behind that.</p>

<p>Dwight is why i�m here. Cat’s in the cradle lyrics: The cat�s in the cradle is an old harry chapin song, and i�ve always assumed that that particular phrase originated with the song. The cat�s in the cradle presents the problem of personal and extreme dedication to work and the subsequent neglect of family by a father or any parent or guardian of a child. Harry chapin originally released cat�s in the cradle written by harry chapin and sandra chapin and harry chapin released it on the album verities &amp; balderdash in 1974.</p>

<p>The band�s name spoofs that of another band, pretty boy floyd. Harry chapin uses multiple literary devices in the song “cats in the cradle”. Ugly kid joe�s sound includes a range of styles, including hard rock, funk metal and heavy metal. I�ve had a range of unrelated people insist to me that this is a cat stevens song, but it�s definitely harry chapin. The 1974 song of harry chapin, based on a song written together with his wife sandy, tells a simple and sad story clearly and well.</p>
