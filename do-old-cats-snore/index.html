Just like humans, cats’ natural snore can be caused by an awkward sleeping position. A study into human sleeping problems by the mayo clinic in 2001 found that pets often had a role to play when their owners were having trouble nodding off.</p>

<p>Is it normal for cats to snore cute cat snore snoring cat. Why do old cats snore. One of my cats snores quite loud when he sleeps. “lots of cats are overweight, so that is a big factor to consider,” jones says. It almost sounds like she is snoring, but i don�t know if cats snore like people do or if it means she is having some kind of breathing problem?</p>

<p>If this is the case, the sound should be brief and stop when your cat changes positions. Yes cats can snore i have 4 cats 3 females 1 male they all snore though not at the same time. It is important as with other behaviors to be familiar with what is normal for your cat. Some cats snore but some are not. “lots of cats are overweight, so that is a big factor to consider,” jones says.</p>
