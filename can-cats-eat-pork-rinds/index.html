<p>Pork is not harmful to cats, even if consumed in large quantities. Just about anything that is accidentally dropped on the floor, really. If you allow your cat to eat pieces of sausage, make sure it doesn�t contain onion powder or leeks as these are toxic to cats. Seriously, the answers people are giving are going so far off the path that the truth is entirely lost. Understand that cats are obligate carnivores, and that.</p>

<p>If you allow your cat to eat pieces of sausage, make sure it doesn�t contain onion powder or leeks as these are toxic to cats. But, they should only eat it in moderation and if you want to be overly cautious about your cat’s diet, just don’t give them any. The answer to the question of can dogs eat pork, is a definite yes. Most pork rinds are cooked in peanut oil (or other some such plant based oil) and topped with seasonings and flavorings, and there may also be some preservatives. Dogs should avoid all fried products, period.</p>
