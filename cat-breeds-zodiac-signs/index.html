<p>One of the most vocal cat breeds, they know when and how to use their �meow� to garner attention. That’s good, the native of cancer is fond of hugs and pussies of all kinds and can spend hours huddled with him on the sofa in the living room! It is a sweet cat, just waiting to be curled up! Their astrological specifics may differ from those of human beings, but there is no harm in accepting if your cat is a leo or a libra. If you are a sphinx lover you won t get along with a persian cat.</p>
