<p>There are two types of kidney failure in cats. Kittens can be born with kidney diseases. Progressive kidney disease (known as chronic renal failure) is common in cats and the earlier it is detected, the quicker it can be treated. Acute kidney failure is when the problem appears suddenly and it can affect cats of all ages. Trauma, toxins, and infection are also causes.</p>
