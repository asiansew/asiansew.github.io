<p>Fun cat facts, interesting facts or just weird facts about cats are all over the internet. One of the more sobering cat facts: The global conservation status for the sand cat is least concern (lc) due to the wide range and estimated numbers, however it is not abundant anywhere and occurs naturally at low densities. Sand cats are only known to occur in sandy and stony deserts, and they are able to survive in extreme conditions with sand temperatures reaching over 225 degrees (f). Hopefully this video will inspire you to support feline conservation efforts around the globe.</p>
