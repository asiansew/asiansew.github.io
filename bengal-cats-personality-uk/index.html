<p>Although bengal cats are popular pets, they too find themselves without homes on occasion. The bengal cat breed was further used to create another breed of cat called the toyger which is the result of the crossing of bengal cats and domestic shorthair cats. Bengal cats and kittens are friendly, intelligent and very lively. The bengal cat is a breed of domestic chickens made from the offspring of domestic cats, especially the egyptian domesticated, asian cat (purionailurus bengalensis cat). For all the talk you hear about the amazing beauty of the bengal cat, you could be forgiven for assuming that a bengal possesses normal domestic cat behaviour, just with wonderful markings as well.</p>
