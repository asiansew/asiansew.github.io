<p>Yet some people still refuse to get their cats fixed. It’s easy to do with the right items. Many cats dislike water because it takes so long for them to warm up again afterward. Unfortunately, like us, our feline friends can get colds too. The cool winter weather not only impacts our lifestyle, it affects our feline friends too.</p>

<p>Just like humans, cats are different from one another. Cold cats in the winter. The cold makes their joints especially stiff and tender, which can make life a bit more awkward and complicated than usual. Give the gift of warmth. Kittens or young cats do not have entirely developed immune systems.</p>
