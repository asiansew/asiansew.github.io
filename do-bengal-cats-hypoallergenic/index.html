Regular brushing is usually considered to be about once a week on average. Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva. Bengal kittens do not shed as much as other breeds, but shedding increases with age.</p>

<p>However, in order to decrease shedding even more regular brushing is always recommended. In addition, bengal cats shed considerably less than other cat breeds, so the dander in their fur doesn’t spread around as much. Bengal cats are one of the most hypoallergenic cats. When something is hypoallergenic, that means it’s relatively unlikely to cause an allergic reaction. However, as we’ll get to later, they may not have as much dander as other cats which could mean that they are hypoallergenic.</p>
