<p>Sometimes the owners move house and leave the cat. Cats and kittens come into our protection for a number of reasons. Fine with kids and other cats, seems ok with dogs. Whilst waiting to meet you, your new family member is getting all the care they need in one of our animal centres. You can cancel your email alerts at any time.</p>

<p>Help us help pets find forever homes. Whilst waiting to meet you, your new family member is getting all the care they need in one of our animal centres. Cat adoptions directly from the current owner or shelter. See our updated adoption process or fostering process for more details. Rehoming your pet keeps them out of an animal shelter and provides you the peace of mind that you personally selected your petâs new family.</p>
