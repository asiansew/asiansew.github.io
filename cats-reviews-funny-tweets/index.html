<p>View this post on 6. Under obama, his role was essentially to be a management consultant for the executive branch: Thanks for this safe place to fall. The review embargo for the upcoming movie adaptation of cats, directed by tom hooper, lifted on wednesday night and critics all across the internet have been coughing up furballs. Cats stars, inexplicably, judi dench, idris elba, jennifer hudson, ian mckellen, taylor swift and james corden.</p>

<p>The cats movie reviews are in, and folks, they are…not great. The embargo on cats reviews lifted on wednesday night, around the time the house’s impeachment vote was happening, and there’s. The teaser and the trailers were viral news alone for the creepy digital fur technology used to fuse the cats with the human bodies of the actors. Still, the film — in which a bunch of anthropomorphic cats sing and dance in a competition to see who will. Twitter, of course, has a lot to say.</p>

<p>The funniest cats tweets by scott russell december 19, 2019 | 1:45pm cats national tour by ellen johnson august 7, 2019 | 4:58pm idris elba joins tom hooper’s cats adaptation by stephan cho. Universal here are the best and funniest tweets about the 2:22 experience we all had to endure: The cats movie reviews are in, and folks, they are…not great. They might be the best part of the whole thing. We gotta say though, some of these reviews are so ridiculous that they almost make us want to go watch the movie.</p>

<p>The embargo on cats reviews lifted on wednesday night, around the time the house’s impeachment vote was happening, and there’s. When the first official cats trailer dropped in july, twitter users had a lot of questions, like, is it necessary for them to have boobs? and why is cat judi dench wearing a fur coat? well, on tuesday, the second trailer for the cats movie came out, and—spoiler alert—it�s just as bizarre as the first. Two cats in pants, gnorm demands romance, give vaccines the sausage chance, paddington twitter enhanced, and much more from this week in funny tweets. I’ve never been more profoundly, alarmingly, curiously and viscerally aware of genitalia. By now you�ve seen the trailer for the new cats movie and, my goodness, it�s something.</p>
