From ingestion dangers to electric shock, many customary christmas decorations can be hazardous to dogs and cats. While eating poinsettias can cause mild stomach upset in dogs and cats, other poisonous holiday plants like mistletoe, holly, amaryllis, and lilies can cause much worse health effects like low.</p>

<p>While poinsettias may not be severely toxic for cats, the hype about them has kept people from being aware of other dangers and more poisonous holiday plants. As for cats, it can be a little harmful, but not fatal. Are poinsettias really dangerous to cats, dogs &amp; babies? Still, if you suspect that your cat has been chewing on a poinsettia or another holiday plant, it might be a good idea to take him to a veterinarian for a checkup. The poinsettia is commonly “hyped” as a poisonous plant.</p>

<p>They will cause your cat to be sick, but they won�t kill your cat. Are poinsettias poisonous to cats and dogs? During the holidays, poinsettias are a popular christmas plant. Although this holiday plant is one of the most notoriously dangerous, it�s actually only mildly toxic for animals. It�s possible that poinsettias get the bummest rap in the plant world.</p>

<p>The reality is, a poinsettia is only mildly toxic to cats and dogs. That was always what my mom would tell me: As ingestion of poinsettias only causes mild symptoms, there are no recommendations in regards to keeping cats safe other than to ensure the plant is kept out of reach of cats who are prone to nibble. Toxicity although the aspca doesn�t consider the poinsettia to be deadly to pets, it does still classify the plant as toxic to both felines and canines. They will cause your cat to be sick, but they won�t kill your cat.</p>
