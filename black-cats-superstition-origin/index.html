<p>In some places however, black cats were seen as a sign of fortune and good luck, and in ancient egypt black cats especially were worshipped. In modern american society, most people don’t necessarily believe the old superstitions about black cats. Since they are nocturnal and black, they became affiliated with evil and darkness. Though history hasn’t been as kind to our furry friends as we are today, their mysterious nature has always been revered. According to scientific animal classification, a black cat is a cat (often domestic) with black fur, which is an indicator of a mixed or specific breed.</p>

<p>Since they are nocturnal and black, they became affiliated with evil and darkness. As a result, the black cat superstition had found a permanent place in american history, and many people used this a justified excuse for the mistreatment and abuse of black cats. During the middle ages, people in many other parts of europe held quite the opposite belief. Black cats feature in the superstitions of many countries — but whether they mean good luck or bad varies. 1* many are wondering, is it good to have a black cat in the house.</p>
