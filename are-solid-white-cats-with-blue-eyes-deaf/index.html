The reason, as you may have guessed, is heredity: Is that true, and why? White cats with one or two blue eyes do, however, have a higher incidence of genetic deafness, with the white gene occasionally causing the.</p>

<p>However, the prevalence of white cats does vary in different geographies. Grade 10 white spotted cats resemble solid white cats, but are rarely deaf. 40 percent of white cats with one blue eye were deaf; This is not always the case: You can help a deaf cat lead a happy, full life by keeping it protected indoors and learning to use visual signals and vibrations to communicate.</p>

<p>The deaf ear is usually on the same side as the blue eye. That rate drops to around 40 percent when the cat has only one blue eye, but the side with the blue eye will be the deaf side. In solid white cats that have one blue eye, and the other is a different color, they are often deaf in the ear that�s on the blue eyed side. The easiest way to determine whether or not a cat is an albino is by looking at their eyes. Your white breed cat may have one blue eye and one green or yellow eye.</p>

<p>Still, look at it this way: My vet said they don�t have the gene to hear. And in addition to rio�s sweetie: Albino cats are not linked to deafness. The reason, as you may have guessed, is heredity:</p>
