<p>Pumpkin is a fabulous source of fiber for our furry friends, as well as for us. Pumpkin pie filling contains sugar and spices that not only are unnecessary for your dog’s diet but may cause the digestive upset you are trying to prevent. Only pure and fresh pumpkin is safe for cats. Don’t use pumpkin pie filling, or any canned pumpkin that contains other ingredients, such as sugars and/or flavorings. If you can pumpkins, you use small pie pumpkins, not just any old pumpkin.</p>
