<p>Why do cats have whiskers. Whiskers also serve as a way for cats to visually measure distance, which is why they are able to leap so quickly and gracefully onto a narrow ledge or out of harm’s way. Yes, cats have whiskers including their kittens, i.e., they have the longer ones or macrovibrissae on the side of their muzzle (the projected part of their face or snout) and shorter ones above their eyes (eyebrow like), on their chin and on their front legs. It helps the cat detect changes in the surroundings. The whiskers of cats even shed or fall off like the other hair present in different areas in the body of cats.</p>
