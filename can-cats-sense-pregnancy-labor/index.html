A female cat can get pregnant when they are as young as 4 months old, unless they have been spayed to prevent that. During pregnancy, you experience profound changes in your hormonal levels, when your body begins producing more progesterone, estrogen and human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) hormones.</p>

<p>3 between 4 and 8 weeks you will notice your cat’s restlessness and discomfort. 1 signs of pregnancy will be few in the first two weeks. Well, at some point it will know it’s pregnant but it’s hard to know exactly when it finds out. How soon can cats sense pregnancy? You can try to make your cat comfortable where you would like her to have her kittens (you may have a box or an area already set up), but don’t force the issue.</p>

<p>Anyway, i�ve had a lot of prelabor symptoms for the past few days and now both of my. 0 like this post log in add an account. Earthquakes records as far back as ancient greece tells of. Without a doubt, dogs can tell when a woman is pregnant, partly because they can smell changes in the woman�s body as her hormones shift. Dogs are incredibly intuitive and aware of their surroundings.</p>

<p>Pregnancy, your dog, and that sixth sense while there is no scientific proof that explains precisely why dogs, or any other animal for that matter, can pick up on pregnancy, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence. It might all seem a little far fetched, but let�s see what the experts have to say. Cats have been known to kill and eat their babies if threatened by other animals or too much human interference. Even spayed females have some wiring in their brain that relates to labor and delivery. When my sister was pregnant our oldest cat just lay on our bump like she was protecting my unborn nephew and she never done that they say cats can sense death and that so wouldnt be surpise if they can sense labour is commin as they have a six sense so good luck tonight could be the night you get to see you baby have a good labour.xxx</p>
