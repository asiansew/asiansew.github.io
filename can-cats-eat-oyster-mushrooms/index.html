The funghi grow naturally on and near trees in temperate and subtropic forests around the world, and they�re grown commercially in many countries. While dogs are far more likely to eat mushrooms than cats, it is advised you avoid giving your cats any type of mushrooms to be on the safe side. Mushrooms are not safe for cats to eat, but there is an exception.store bought mushrooms can be fine for cats to eat in small amounts, but overall, it�s best to avoid all fungi when it comes to your cat�s diet.</p>

<p>To be on the safe side, mushrooms are not recommended for cats. Guinea pigs can only eat raw mushrooms. A few types of fungi are deadly, such as the death cap mushroom. Within a few hours of eating the mushroom, the pup’s liver and immune system were wrecked beyond repair. Toadstools are also varieties of fungi, although they can sometimes be mistaken for mushrooms.</p>

<p>Dogs can have mushrooms, but there are only specific types of food that are safe to eat. Never give cooked mushrooms to guinea pig. The most common symptoms of fungi poisoning are gastrointestinal upsets such as vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pains. However, cats shouldn’t eat wild mushrooms, as they can be poisonous, and mushrooms shouldn’t make up a significant portion of a cat’s diet. Puppy’s digestive system is more delicate so monitor your pup when introducing mushrooms into his diet.</p>
