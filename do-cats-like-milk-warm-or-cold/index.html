<p>The most important is to keep your cat indoors. # warm up your cats canned food, broth, water or milk. Cow�s milk, warm or otherwise, can make some cats sick. Although some cats obviously enjoy cow�s milk, many cats do not. Warm your kitten�s formula before feeding, especially if you prepare it ahead of time and refrigerate it.</p>

<p>Cats do like having routines. While most people prefer drinking hot milk, some may also like it cold.hot milk is exposed to heat and may or may not change chemically and nutritionally, whereas cold milk has all the nutrients intact. Cats dislike standing water, fresh or not, cold or room temp. If it is a kitten, give it warm or room temperature milk. Like people, cats associate certain flavors and scents with positive memories, so milk is like comfort food for them.</p>
