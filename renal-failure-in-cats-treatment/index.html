The disease is irreversible and prevents these organs from performing their functions normally, so the body of the affected cat does not get the filtering and elimination of impurities from the blood. I have seen kidney failure in cats as young as 4 years, but far more frequently in much older cats. Acute renal failure is reversible and treatable if noticed in time. How is renal failure diagnosed?</p>

<p>Acute renal failure in cats (arf) is potentially reversible if diagnosed early and treated aggressively. Feed cats with symptoms of chronic renal failure a diet designed specifically for cats with renal disease. It is mostly seen in cats over the age of three. Renal failure is usually diagnosed by a blood test and urinalysis. Reduce phosphorus intake with renal diets and enteric phosphate binders (if needed to meet goals).—this is a major treatment goal for dogs and cats with stage 2 and beyond ckd.</p>
