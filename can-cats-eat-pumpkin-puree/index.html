<p>If you grind the pumpkin seeds they are easier to digest, and a much simpler method. Most of the time, cats would love the taste of pumpkin and wouldn’t mind eating it as a puree or straight from a can. Technically, you could also cook and then puree fresh pumpkin for your cat, but this may require more time and effort than you bargained for. You might start by mixing anywhere from 1 to 4 teaspoons of plain canned pumpkin into your adult kitty’s wet food, and you can. Thanks to its very high fiber content, canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling) is a great way to get your cat’s gastrointestinal system moving if he’s a bit stopped up.</p>

<p>Even though feeding pumpkin to a cat has minimal risks, we advise that you talk with the vet prior to making any dietary changes. But, you should not add any added sugar and spice to pumpkin. “it will get the colon moving a little better in cats predisposed to constipation,” he says. These kitties usually need more than pumpkin to keep them regular, but many cats like pumpkin. In fact, pumpkin is a type of squash, and it’s very healthy for cats.</p>
