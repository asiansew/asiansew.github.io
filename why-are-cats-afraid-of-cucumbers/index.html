<p>Cats tend to be scared or wary of the unknown, as it could represent the danger of a predator, and in the case of a cucumber, a snake. Some people have argued that it could be the smell of the cucumber. The vast majority of people have never been harmed by snakes or spiders, but, just the same, the fear exists. Obviously not, and bloom affirms that there’s no reason to believe cats are afraid of cucumbers in particular. More than 21 million views have a collection of videos of cats and cucumbers that are posted on youtube about this.</p>
