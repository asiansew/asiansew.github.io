<p>Your cat might nosh on some cooked carrots, but avoid raw ones as they may be a. Make sure that the carrot is washed before feeding your dogs. Once again, this will depend on how big your dog is. To be safe, always start off with just a few slices of carrots. Introducing that much oil and sugar into a puppy’s diet is a fast track to an upset stomach.</p>

<p>However, there are a couple caveats we’ll want to address when feeding dogs carrots as well…but first, the good stuff. Last updated on july 25, 2019. Not only can dogs safely eat carrots, but carrots are a low calorie treat with tremendous health and dental benefits. As is true for most vegetables, however, carrots should be cooked before feeding them to your cat. Baby food is just pureed food, after all, and it can be very helpful in certain situations.</p>
