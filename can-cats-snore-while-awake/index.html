You may have several cats and only one of them snores while the others sleep peacefully like little angels. Best dog food for lab puppies. Just like humans, some cats snore and others do not. Astridor is a high tone that you sometimes hear while the cat is breathing, and astertor is a low tone that can sound like a snore.</p>

<p>Like people (and dogs), cats occasionally snore while they are sleeping. I have a male orange tabby manx cat that suddenly started making a snoring sound on inhale while awake, he also has an occasional runny nose, increased eye boogies. In some circumstances, snoring can be a sign of a health issue. Noises that sound like snoring while your cat is awake: Just like humans, some cats snore and others do not.</p>

<p>Although snoring while awake is essentially standard in bulldogs, it’s not as common in cats — and that’s a good thing, because snoring while awake sometimes can be linked to breathing difficulties. The snoring sounds may sound like soft purrs, heavy breathing, or a freight train coming through the house. Sometimes their sleepy sounds are perfectly normal, and other times, they can be cause for concern. Beyond a rapid onset of snoring, owners should also be wary of symptoms of distressed breathing while the cat is awake. Sometimes,cats make snoring noises when they are awake.</p>
