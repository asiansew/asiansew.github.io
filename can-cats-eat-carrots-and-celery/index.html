<p>Other vegetables cats can eat. When you do feed your chicken celery, there are few things to keep in mind and do to ensure that your pet bird stays safe and healthy: It’s a thumbs up to gnawing on green beans and chewing on celery, but a thumbs down for raw potato or squash. While your kitty can eat raw celery, you should cook it the same way you’ll do with broccoli. You can serve your cat with celery but in a moderation.</p>

The vegetable actually has a lot of health benefits for a cat, mostly in the form of its high vitamin and fiber content.</p>
