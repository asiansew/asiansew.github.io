The white fur and blue eyes both are a consequence of a lack of melanin from pigment cells. If this is not treated early, cats will not be able to hear as well as they should be able to. Cats with blue eyes can sometimes have visual or auditory deficiencies. When the white spot gene affects both eyes the cat will have blue eyes.

Many cats are born with congenital deafness, which causes deafness in the cat as it ages, instead of later on. Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf. There is a gene/gene complex which causes white coat, blue eyes and deafness, but not all cats get their white coat and blue eyes from that particular gene, so not all white cats will be deaf.</p>

<p>If a cat with odd eyes is deaf, it is always on the same side as the blue eye. A survey of 185 white cats reported the following results: If a cat with odd eyes is deaf, it is always on the same side as the blue eye. 2 cats with white coats and blue eyes are highly likely to be deaf in one or both ears.

<p>However, the prevalence of white cats does vary in different geographies. However, there is no need to be feared to bring a cat with blue eyes home because more than 50 percents of cats who are not pure white, their blue eyes are not always related to deafness and blindness. Mine is not fully white, it has some pigmentation on the tail, although it does have both eyes blue. Some of these breeds only ever have. However, things are not quite that simple and clear cut.</p>

In one 1997 study of white cats, 72% of the animals were found to be totally deaf. Cats that have the dominant white gene can sometimes, but not always, have blue eyes.</p>
