<p>If a cat with odd eyes is deaf, it is always on the same side as the blue eye. A survey of 185 white cats reported the following results: If a cat with odd eyes is deaf, it is always on the same side as the blue eye. 2 cats with white coats and blue eyes are highly likely to be deaf in one or both ears.
