<p>Pain also can be indicated either by a constricting or dilating of your cat�s pupils. While a cat’s eyes can communicate how he’s feeling, generally they convey just one part of the overall message. Cats dilate their pupils when they stare at their prey and prepare to attack. The messages vary from subtle to overt and can be incredibly powerful. Pain in the eyes themselves is usually accompanied by the constricting of a cat�s pupils, while pain elsewhere in the body can be accompanied by dilated pupils.</p>

<p>Cats that are ill will usually show changes in overall appearance, energy level, sociability, coat appearance and/or amount of shedding, appetite, litterbox usage, breathing, or discharges from the eyes or nose. Also, squinting behavior and bloodshot eyes are indicators of pain in cats. The dog starts panting the minute she is back in her room. Dilated pupils can signify serious infection, head or brain trauma or tumor, poisoning, or disease and will need diagnostic tests to determine the cause. You might also notice very dilated pupils as your cat’s eyes try to get more light into the back of the eye.</p>
