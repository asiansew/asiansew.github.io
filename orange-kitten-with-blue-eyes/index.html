<p>You are buying the exact pet(s) you see in the pictures. You will find no fancy graphics here, just a little pet looking for a good home! This could possibly be the cutest baby you’ll see today, or maybe the you’ve seen in a while… just take a deep breath, and let those. Then i googled if it was rare, and they say both parent have to be red so there would could be a red orange female, but her parents were orange (father) and dark grey. The youngest are probably 5 weeks old and their eyes are mostly green now rather than kitten blue.</p>

<p>I�ve seen them in japanese bobtails. Most kittens, when their eyes open at about 2 weeks old, have light blue eyes, and johnson said that over the next month or two the eye color changes to the color it will be throughout her adult life. The youngest are probably 5 weeks old and their eyes are mostly green now rather than kitten blue. For the first several weeks after a kitten’s eyes open, they appear to be blue. I adopted two male orange kittens, they are both with blue eyes, but the other one is with a clean deep blue eyes, and that cat turned out to be a female.</p>
