<p>If the eye color of the cat is completely white, then blue eyes in cats is highly unlikely. Two blue eyes, completely deaf. White spotting and white are also different genes but it�s the white that can cause deafness. Cats with blue eyes are not necessarily deaf and should not be made to suffer because of it. How do cats get blue eyes?</p>

<p>Why are blue eyed white cats usually deaf. Many cats are born with congenital deafness, which causes deafness in the cat as it ages, instead of later on. Cats that have the dominant white gene can sometimes, but not always, have blue eyes. Then again there was a brown cat with blue eyes. The reason, as you may have guessed, is heredity:</p>

<p>In a cat with the white spot gene the deafness usually occurs in the ear affected by the spot. White cats are also genetically more predisposed to being deaf. When it comes to white cats, they can be deaf no matter the eye color. The easiest way to determine whether or not a cat is an albino is by looking at their eyes. If the eye color of the cat is completely white, then blue eyes in cats is highly unlikely.</p>
