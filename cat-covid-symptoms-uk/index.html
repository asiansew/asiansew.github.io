<p>Cat owners with suspected covid should stay away from their pets because owners can pass on the disease, a study has found. Not only can finding the worms be frightful (and gross), but their presence can also raise some serious concerns about the health of your cat. The animal is believed to have developed symptoms about a week after its owner. Covid is spreading across the uk, and the government is urging anybody with coronavirus symptoms or signs to get tested straight away. Currently the evidence is limited and the number of cats involved is extremely low, implying transmission from humans to cats is extremely rare.</p>
