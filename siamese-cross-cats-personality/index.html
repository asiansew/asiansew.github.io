Since the two top answer have people saying “it doesn’t matter” and then throwing in anecdotal evidence to say otherwise, i’ll just tell you what my 7 year old siamese/tabby is like. Other than their magnificent coats that are inherited, the siamese cats also have other traits, which make them a unique breed. The siamese is also (arguably) the most recognizable breed on the planet. Siamese cats are one of the oldest house cats in the world.</p>

<p>Wedge shaped heads and striking blue almond shaped eyes are the norm today. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, siamese cats were imported into north america from britain, france, japan, and siam. From there, each category is broken down into further groups based on color, stature and facial features (and often times personality). The nine types of siamese cat can be broken down into two major groups which split into smaller variations. Siamese cats come from the ancient kingdom of siam (currently thailand), where it�s said that this breed could only be owned by royalty.</p>

<p>I now know that kittens go through adolescence like puppies do. Most people would agree who have owned a siamese cat, that they are unique. Nystagmus is a congenital condition that affects siamese cats. But siamese cats are divided into many types, dictated by color and breeding. Other than their magnificent coats that are inherited, the siamese cats also have other traits, which make them a unique breed.</p>

<p>So danzig has a siamese body shape and personaility but black fur. Siamese cats, admired by royalty in asia, continued their proud status by taking up residency in the white house in the 1800s. I believe that every cat breed has its own particular nature, and the temperament of the siamese cat makes it quite unlike other breeds. The siamese cat’s seal point coloration was first seen in a kingdom’s royal court as they play the role of a royal feline in the kingdom of siam (now called thailand). The siamese is definately the more prominant of the two parents.</p>
