<p>Most cat owners have a tough time handling shedding in cats. They have a very short, fine coat that is really easy to maintain. I dont kno of any cat that doesnt shed besides the hairless breed. Whitney, except for the sphynx breeds and peterbald (all hairless cats), all cats shed. One thing to keep in mind is that most of the pets on this list don’t shed a lot of dander.</p>

<p>These cats make great pets for owners who don’t have the time for regular brushing or vacuuming, and they are also ideal for allergy sufferers. One way u can reduce shedding is giving them a good healthy diet and comb them down. In fact, there are 40 different (small and big) hypoallergenic dog breeds to choose from. Also, the fur comes off very easily during cleaning. Finding cat hair all over the house can get quite irksome in terms of health and sanitation.</p>

<p>And a few cat breeds don’t even have much hair to shed. These cats make great pets for owners who don’t have the time for regular brushing or vacuuming, and they are also ideal for allergy sufferers. These pretty cats are notable for their signature cream and grey fur and large eyes. Popular cats that don’t shed. Sphynx of course, but they are very high maintenance and need weekly baths or they will make oily stains on your furniture.</p>
