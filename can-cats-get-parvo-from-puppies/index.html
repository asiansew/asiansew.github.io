<p>A less common form of parvo can attack the heart. How do dogs get parvo? Can a puppy get parvo from a cat? Also, dogs and cats cannot get parvovirus b19 from an infected person. The cat strain, called feline panleukopenia virus (fpv), is a significant disease threat amongst the feline community, but it cannot be transferred to canines.</p>

<p>People who handle an infected cat or an infected cat�s bedding, food, or water dish can carry the virus to the next cat they handle. While dogs cannot catch feline parvovirus, the virus can mutate and be spread to cats. Puppies under 6 weeks of age retain immunity from their vaccinated mother. As cats and dogs are different and distinct species, there are many illnesses that will not spread between them. Can a puppy get parvo from a cat?</p>

<p>Puppies can be more affected and can display symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, cough, difficulty breathing, jaundice, seizures, and even death if it. Does it mean your pooch is going to die if you do not get him the treatment? Canine parvovirus can live for many months outside of an infected animal. We recommend always asking your local vet for clarification if you are unsure! Not everyone has that kind of money.</p>
