<p>Quran talks about dogs in 2 places. Cats have been venerated in the near east since antiquity, a tradition adopted by islam, albeit in a much modified form. Lions and cats are in the same family. Sahih bukhari 2:26:623 narrated �ali: The quran mentions dogs twice, including the permission to eat meat that has been carried by hunting dogs.</p>

<p>In fact ironically, it is a medieval christian belief that cats are agents of the devil. Islam has no place for black cats and broken mirrors. In europe people have that stupid superstition about black cats, in sunni islam it’s about black dogs. What does quran say about dogs?? I�ve always grown up with pet cats and i fall in love with every single one i meet.</p>
