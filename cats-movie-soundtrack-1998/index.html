<p>Andrew lloyd webber’s cats, the most famous musical of all time, first exploded onto the west end stage in 1981. The music for the film was composed by andrew lloyd webber.the song beautiful ghosts by taylor swift, the lead single from the soundtrack album, was released on november 15, 2019. A tribe of cats called the jellicles must decide yearly which one will ascend to the heaviside layer and come back to a new jellicle life. Though the book contains no narrative structure, webber has created one, although what drew audiences to the theatre in droves was the charm of the feline characters, not the tale of what happens to them. I bought the soundtrack on amazon for $3.49.</p>
