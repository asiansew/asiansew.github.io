<p>If a cat�s yearly age is determined by multiplying seven (a rough estimate, to be sure), then a cat pregnancy is really 14 months long. Your cat (queen) often won’t show any physical symptoms of pregnancy until she is a few weeks into her term. The cat gestation period can vary from as short as 61 days to as long as 72 days. In this short time, a litter of cuddly kittens will grow from fertilized egg cells. From the first day she gets pregnant to the day she delivers and the kittens start to wean, you should seek the vet’s advice.</p>
