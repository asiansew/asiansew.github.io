<p>Since cats are carnivorous in nature, their digestive systems are not equipped to digest plant material very well at all. Yogurt has a lot of good stuff in it. People who were little girls back in the 80�s might remember a little (highly merchandised) character named strawberry shortcake who lived in a giant strawberry shaped house and had a little pink cat with white polka dots named custard. Can my cat eat carrots? Take the following risks into consideration before offering a cat banana.</p>
