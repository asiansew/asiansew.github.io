<p>There’s a known fact that cats are predators and they use their senses a lot more than we humans do. Though they don’t always display their affection in the same ways that we do, they do try to demonstrate their love through their own love language. Here’s a list of 9 signs your cat actually loves you: In the cat world, there are many ways to express oneself, including these 12 displays of love.

<p>“this study shows that cats do not need their humans to feel safe, they don’t depend on us, they look after themselves. But how a cat shows their love and gives affection is very different from how humans display love. They found that cats have the capacity to form attachments to their caregivers in the same way that children and dogs do. So do cats love their owners? Domestic cats share far more dna with their wild cousins than pet dogs do with wolves, so our feline friends may need a boost to help them bond with another species.</p>

<p>So do cats love their owners? They found that cats have the capacity to form attachments to their caregivers in the same way that children and dogs do. Those that don’t (generally dog people), however, claim cats are selfish creatures who show no affection and think they’re better.

My cats will actively follow me around even when sleeping somewhere they would otherwise stay for hours.</p>
