Meaning, you can eat some of it, but not so much of it. Eating a lot of applesauce makes your cat’s blood sugar rise, which can cause several health problems. Cats can get the same health benefits from apples as humans do.</p>

<p>A subreddit dedicated to making media more straightforward by spoiling clickbait. This fruit is very toxic to dogs, cats and most animals.

<p>Red delicious, honeycrisp, gala and granny smith—basically all varieties of apples that you’d commonly find at your neighborhood grocery store—are safe for dogs to eat. Apples are fine just remove the seeds. Although bananas are high in protein, fiber, and vitamins, they are also high in natural sugars which can lead to obesity and diabetes. Cats have less ability to metabolize theobromine compared to humans and can lead to chocolate poisoning. There�s lots of fruit and veggies that they can and can�t eat so it�s a good idea to have a quick google search before feeding them something new.</p>
