<p>Coat color and an aspect of the cat’s personality or another aspect of anatomy can be linked if the gene that dictates the cat’s colour and a gene which affects the way the brain develops are situated close together on the same chromosome. The reason, as you may have guessed, is heredity: White cats can have blue, gold, green or copper coloured odd eyes. Coat color and an aspect of the cat’s personality or another aspect of anatomy can be linked if the gene that dictates the cat’s colour and a gene which affects the way the brain develops are situated close together on the same chromosome. When the white spot gene affects both eyes the cat will have blue eyes.</p>

<p>Cats can be deaf in one or both ears. Are cats with blue eyes deaf? Of white cats with one blue eye, about 40 percent are deaf in at least one ear. In addition, cats with albinism are susceptible to suffering from both deafness and blindness. If the eye color of the cat is completely white, then blue eyes in cats is highly unlikely.</p>

<p>A cat with a gene with white spots (like the tuxedo cat) can have blue eyes or in some cases odd eyes. Nevertheless, if she does not adopt her genetic color even after months of her birth, you should consult your vet. If the eye color of the cat is completely white, then blue eyes in cats is highly unlikely. My white cat has 2 blue eyes, and he�s not deaf. However, there is no need to be feared to bring a cat with blue eyes home because more than 50 percents of cats who are not pure white, their blue eyes are not always related to deafness and blindness.</p>

<p>I never thought to check a gold eye white. 65% to 85% deafness occurs if a white cat’s eyes are both blue. A pure white cat with blue eyes has an 85 percent chance of some degree of deafness. White cats need to inherit a particular gene or gene complex to be diagnosed deaf. A cat with a gene with white spots (like the tuxedo cat) can have blue eyes or in some cases odd eyes.</p>
