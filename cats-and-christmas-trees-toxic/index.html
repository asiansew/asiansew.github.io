<p>Artificial christmas trees contain toxins in the materials used to make the christmas tree. Tree needles, if digested can cause gastrointestinal obstruction , gastrointestinal irritation, and/or vomiting. Real christmas trees are potentially more dangerous to your cat than artificial ones. I have heard that they are toxic to cats so i was not a huge fan of having a christmas tree (unless it was a fake christmas tree) but then my other house mate said that he wanted a christmas tree too. Pine needles are mildly toxic.</p>

<p>Christmas trees, whether real or artificial, can be a hazard for homes with pets during the holiday season. Are christmas trees poisonous to cats? Pine needles are mildly toxic. I had no idea, and gave it no thought! (and does your cat go along with what most cats do anyway?) there are two points of concern with eating needles from live christmas trees:</p>
