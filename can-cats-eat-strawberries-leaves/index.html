<p>Cats do not need leaves in general as they provide no valuable nutrients that are essential for cats health. If you eat strawberries cats also have antioxidant activity; Yet, despite being safe for your feline friends, you should give them sparingly as occasional treats. If humans can eat strawberries, can cats safely eat strawberries too? Cats are unable to taste sweetness as they lack the appropriate receptors for taste.</p>
