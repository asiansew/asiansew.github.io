<p>My cats love the whiskas brand, but actually just throwing a piece of their regular food seems to be just as good. A couple of tablespoons is plenty. Soy is a product of soy beans and is only good for those cats that are allergic to cow’s milk. Not all adult cats are lactose intolerant, but many are.

The truth is that this type of milk is not healthy for cats, most especially if it it’s taking the place of a cat’s supposed to be balanced milk. You can only be sure of this if you test your cat’s tolerance to milk. Milk just fills your cat quickly and provides a calorie boost to keep him active and hungry.</p>

<p>Milk just fills your cat quickly and provides a calorie boost to keep him active and hungry. Not all adult cats are lactose intolerant, but many are. But milk is not a natural part of an adult cat�s diet, and in some cases it�s not good for them. That’s because some cats tolerate milk just fine, wynn tells webmd. Drinking milk is also a way to provide water for cats.</p>

<p>Cats probably first developed a taste for cow�s milk from hanging out in dairy barns, where milk was a coveted treat. The test to know if the cat is one of them is simple: Why milk is bad for most cats. This varies, however, and some cats can digest milk sugar into adulthood and maybe for life.” is milk healthy for cats? This means that they don’t have the enzymes needed to digest the lactose in dairy products.</p>

<p>Milk doesn�t part of necessary cat nutrition and many cats suffer stomach upsets or other related problems because their owner thought that they were giving them a treat. My cats love the whiskas brand, but actually just throwing a piece of their regular food seems to be just as good. As with humans, a cat�s digestive tract is constantly changing and in turn modifying the production of certain enzymes (depending on the food). Lactose is a type of sugar found in dairy products. How often can i give milk to my cat?</p>
