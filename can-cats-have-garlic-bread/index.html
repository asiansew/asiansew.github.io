<p>While bread is a relatively safe treat for cats, there is a point where it becomes dangerous. A small amount of onion or garlic in some sauce is not likely to cause problems. “onions, garlic, chives, shallots, leek or anything containing these should be avoided,” he says. Y e s, why no longer, the floor grew to become into in simple terms wiped sparkling via the 9 cats and 3 dogs licking the floor until now the piping warm loaf of butterly delicious garlic bread landed on the floor. Never give your feline friend a bite of bread that has either of these ingredients in it or on it.</p>

<p>Plain, white, baked bread, is the safest type of bread that you can give to your cat as a treat. “so it’s best to feed only treats specifically formulated for cats. These are all part of the allium plant family. Garlic bread will almost certainly catch your dog’s attention, but, along with garlic, it usually contains large amounts of butter, oil, cheese, and herbs that can upset your dog’s stomach. Actually, the toxicity of garlic is 5 times more than that of onions for dogs.</p>

<p>If you have a cat, you need to be aware that garlic, along with chives, leeks, shallots, and onions are poisonous for cats and dogs. As mentioned previously garlic is toxic to cats, therefore garlic bread should be avoided always. Breads often have additional ingredients that are toxic to cats. In fact, some, like onions and garlic, can be downright toxic. However, look for those added ingredients that can make your cat ill.</p>
