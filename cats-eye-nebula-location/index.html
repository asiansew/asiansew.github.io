<p>The cat’s eye nebula, also known as ngc 6543, is a visual “fossil record” of the dynamics and late evolution of a dying star. The cat’s eye nebula was discovered by william herschel on february 15, 1786. A planetary nebula is the glowing gas ejected during the final stages of evolution of a star similar in mass to our sun. The location of the cat’s eye nebula (ngc 6543) in the constellation draco. One of the brightest objects of its type, its resemblance to a cat�s eye is due to a series of gas loops that have been ejected by the central star over the past 1,000 years or so.</p>
