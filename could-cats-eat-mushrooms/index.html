<p>Mushroom texture is similar to that of meat and it could very well help your cat shed some weight in the process, especially if it is used to feeding on treats and other high calorie meat products. Dogs have sweet receptors, too. Mushrooms that are generally safe for human consumption are also good, to some degree and extent, great for cats. Mj have a shroomy day and may all of your days be shroomy. Some people enjoy eating them, some just enjoy looking at them, and some do not give them a second thought.</p>

<p>Pets have been known to eat mushrooms in yards and while on walks. Also known as coriolus versicolor, the turkey tail mushroom received its common name because it resembles the tail of a turkey. Human foods come with different “danger levels” for your cat but you might well be asking ‘what can cats eat that is not cat food’ and some of those might be human foods. Some mushrooms provide enhancements to health. Can contain toxins, which may affect multiple systems in the body, cause shock, and result in death.</p>

<p>Ingesting the wrong type of mushroom can cause neurological issues, kidney failure, digestive problems, hemorrhaging (bleeding) and even death in animals. But just because they�re not likely to be toxic, doesn�t mean it�s a good idea to feed them to your dog, either. 160 pounds), or 19 grams of the pure chemical (ott, 1963, pharmacotheon) at your weight suggestion actually about 130 rats could die eating 15 grams of psilocine. Now, the one good thing is that cats will not choose to eat chocolate on their own. Mushrooms provide a boost to an animal’s immune system, but there are benefits beyond that for dogs.</p>
