Blueberries have been shown to improve night vision, help prevent cell damage, and help with mental function in aging animals. Cats can’t taste sweet flavors. Yes, cats can eat strawberries in small amounts.</p>

<p>That means cats can eat blueberries. Strawberries are juicy and fragrant fruits that your cat can enjoy once in a while. Although they provide an excellent source of vitamin c, folate, potassium, and manganese, as well as antioxidants and fiber, the benefits are not noticeable in cats because they cannot safely consume large amounts. This being said, you should not give your cat blueberries too often, or give too many blueberries to your cat at a time. Your kitty can go ahead and chow down (occasionally) if she finds any of those fruits palatable but there is a catch.</p>
