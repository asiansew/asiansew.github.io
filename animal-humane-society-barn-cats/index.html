<p>Many of these cats are feral or very shy, and so will be seldom seen. Are you willing to help out some cats that just don’t like being inside? Our barn cat program is designed to find feral and community cats safe outdoor homes in barns, warehouses, farms and other safe locations for cats that are not candidates for our traditional adoption programs. All barn cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and available for $25. Barn cats discourage rodents, provide companionship for horses and other farm animals, and can live out their lives in relative security and comfort.</p>
