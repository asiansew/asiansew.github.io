<p>Vaccines are combined into a single injection, so your cat only has to have one needle. The exact vaccine will differ year on year depending on the vaccine schedule, but all cats require vaccination against at least one disease annually. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is one of the most devastating diseases of cats. The aafp guidelines indicate that as they currently lack sufficient proof that the vaccine induces clinically relevant protection, its use is not. Up to now fip has had no effective treatments and no vaccine.</p>

<p>Feline infectious peritonitis or fip is probably the number one fatal viral disease of young cats around the world. Treatment is usually unrewarding and cats deteriorate, eventually succumbing to the disease. It is caused by a type of virus called a coronavirus, which tends to attack the cells of the intestinal wall. This terrible condition is not easy to understand, and scientists are still studying and learning more about it. Feline infectious peritonitis is a dreaded disease, however not all cats who are exposed to it will be infected.the use of the fip vaccine has been controversial.</p>
