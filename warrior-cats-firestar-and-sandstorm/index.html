<p>At the end of the book, tigerclaw is then tigerstar, leader of shadowclan. In firestar�s quest he volunteers to mentor sorrelpaw until she returns from the journey with firestar, showing the two still care for each other. When the morning comes, he decides to go with them, saying goodbye to his. When twolegs destroyed the forest, he led his clan on the great journey and helped them settle into the lake territories. She leaped off of him and landed on the floor of the clearing, pacing over to the edge, as if she was walking away.</p>

Sandstorm accepts, although she gets slightly tense when firestar brings up the name of spottedleaf again. See more ideas about warrior cats, warrior cat, warrior.</p>
