The most popular is that the kneading is a sign of contentment. Kneading, or what many veterinarians call “making biscuits,” is an instinctive behavior that begins in kittens shortly after birth. Cats even have their own techniques—some never use their claws when they knead, and some use all four paws. Why do cats “make biscuits”?</p>

<p>Alternatively, the behavior may be a remnant of a newborn�s kneading of the mother�s teat to stimulate milk secretion. No one is positive what it means when cats knead. Kneading is sometimes colloquially referred to as “ making biscuits ,” because the motion resembles a baker kneading dough. Many cats are known to vomit up their dry food after eating. It all starts with instinct!</p>

<p>It’s usually accompanied by purrs.” now who likes butter with their biscuits? Like many things to do with cats, no one is quite certain why they do it, but there are some very plausible theories. As kittens, a cat will press on the area around the mother cat�s teats to stimulate the flow of milk. But most cats will exhibit this behavior from time to time. This is a question we’ve asked ourselves many times after watching our felines “make biscuits” or “make bread,” as some call it.</p>
