<p><strong>Are Orange Colored Cats Always Male</strong>. Like cats themselves, cat genetics are not always simple and straightforward. First of all, we do know why most orange cats are male. Also called torties for short, tortoiseshell cats combine two colors other than white, either closely mixed or in larger patches. The colors are often described as red and black, but the red patches can instead be orange, yellow, or cream, and the black can instead be chocolate, gray, tabby, or blue.</p>

We have many female orange tabby cats in my practice. Solid, tabby, bicolour, colorpoint and are rarely calico or tortoiseshell. Tortoiseshell cats with the tabby pattern as one of their colors are sometimes referred to. This is a really interesting fact and it tells us that sex and coat color genetics are somehow related, at least in orange cats.</p>

<p>Male cats can only be: Unlike other cats that are named after their breed, ginger cats are named after the color of their coat which is basically orange. And i have heard and noticed that male cats seem to be only one or two colors, and that almost all three colored cats are female. Calico and tortoiseshell cats, however, are almost always female. Cats change colour as they mature, and as the seasons change.</p>

<p>This is because when cats of a certain color get together, the females will often present with tortishell markings. As with humans, female cats have paired sex chromosomes, xx, and male cats have xy sex chromosomes.
