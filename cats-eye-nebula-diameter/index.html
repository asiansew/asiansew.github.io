Cat�s eye nebula or ngc 6543 : Messier 94 (m94), also known as cat’s eye galaxy or croc’s eye galaxy, is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation canes venatici.the cat’s eye galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 8.99 and lies at a distance of 16 million light years from earth. The cat eye nebula, ngc 6543, is a mythical object from the deep sky of the northern hemisphere. William huggins� spectroscopic observation of the cat�s eye in 1864, revealing a spectrum consisting of three bright lines, provided proof that not all `nebulae� consist. The central star is tenth magnitude.</p>

The outer horseshoe shaped ring has a temperature of about 3 million degrees celsius. There are nebulae in other galaxies, just like in our own, but they are usually visible only in the large professional telescopes. The cat�s eye nebula, also known as ngc 6543, or the pearl�s light nebula by the xa�thins, is a planetary nebula it is very prominent in local history, and is even referenced in the terminus system�s flag.
