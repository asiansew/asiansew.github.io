My house is quite dim, even with lights on, so this may be the cause but looking back through photos to the summer, they were constricted when they were supposed to be (and also in real direct sunlight now). My cat had to have an eye removed due to an abscess he is 18 since his op two weeks ago his existing eye has remained dilated.</p>

<p>How long has this been a concern? (a tropine, tropicamide, morphine, clonidine, amphetamine) and plants (such as catnip) can cause dilated pupils in cats. My cat miss kitty usually follows along. The most serious of these are feline leukemia, toxicity, dysautonomia or tumors. Cats can also get primary hypertension.</p>

<p>Our zebulon�s pupils never close to a slit like normal cat�s pupils do in bright light. However, if your cat’s pupils are dilated because of stress or discomfort, the situation should be assessed. If you have a cat with one dilated and one is not, there are a number of things that could be wrong. My dog’s pupils are always dilated if the dog has both pupils dilated and does not see well, it is possible that they are suffering from sards (sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome). Dilated pupils can signify serious infection, head or brain trauma or tumor, poisoning, or disease and will need diagnostic tests to determine the cause.</p>

<p>I took my cat to the ophthalmologist, she found keratitis and conjunctivitis in her eye. It is not a condition in its own right but is usually a symptom of something else. During the day their pupils are small because their eyes don�t need that much light, at night the pupil opens up to let in all available light so they can see in the dark. Miss kitty is three years old. Is he taking any medications?</p>
