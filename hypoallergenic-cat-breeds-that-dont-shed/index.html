<p>Many breeds on the top hypoallergenic breeds list require regular bathing anyway, but baths decrease loose hair where applicable, dander, oils, and saliva. Most cat breeds have some shedding and relase pet dander which is what actually causes the allergies not the hair. The cornish rex is also a very playful breed, so they could be the perfect choice for someone who wants an active playmate for themselves or their other pets. The devon rex cat has a slender muscular body, oddly shaped head and a long skinny neck. Dogs that shed tend to leave their hair everywhere.</p>
