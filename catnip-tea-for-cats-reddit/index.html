<p>Catnip (nepeta cataria) is a perennial herb that is a member of the mint family. One of my cats will not touch wet food. It will repel fleas, and you can also crush it up and rub it into your cat�s skin to help protect against fleas. Sometimes when life gets hard, we, as humans, have the option to puff a cigarette, drink some tea, or even have a relaxing beer. It can cause headaches , vomiting , and a feeling of being ill.</p>

<p>I still have a good amount of the concentrated product that i�m gonna use strictly for tea, so the reduction and all turned out to be sort of pointless, but maybe it would make a good chew. When being used as a tea, the oil in catnip plays as a mild sedative. Catnip’s soothing properties make it useful in treating colds, flu, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms. An infusion of catnip leaves may also. They�re just going to toll around in the tea and and make a mess.</p>
